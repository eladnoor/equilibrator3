Both steady-state and dynamic labelling approaches have been adopted in the study of plant metabolism. Here the conceptual basis of these complementary approaches, as well as their historical application in microbial, mammalian and plant sciences, is reviewed, and an update on technical developments in label distribution analyses is provided. This is supported by illustrative cases studies involving the kinetic modelling of secondary metabolism. One issue that is particularly complex in the analysis of plant fluxes is the extensive compartmentation of the plant cell. This problem is discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, and the current approaches used to address it are assessed.

	abstract = {The study of intracellular metabolic fluxes and inter-species metabolite exchange for microbial communities is of crucial importance to understand and predict their behaviour. The most authoritative method of measuring intracellular fluxes, 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C MFA), uses the labeling pattern obtained from metabolites (typically amino acids) during 13C labeling experiments to derive intracellular fluxes. However, these metabolite labeling patterns cannot easily be obtained for each of the members of the community. Here we propose a new type of 13C MFA that infers fluxes based on peptide labeling, instead of amino acid labeling. The advantage of this method resides in the fact that the peptide sequence can be used to identify the microbial species it originates from and, simultaneously, the peptide labeling can be used to infer intracellular metabolic fluxes. Peptide identity and labeling patterns can be obtained in a high-throughput manner from modern proteomics techniques. We show that, using this method, it is theoretically possible to recover intracellular metabolic fluxes in the same way as through the standard amino acid based 13C MFA, and quantify the amount of information lost as a consequence of using peptides instead of amino acids. We show that by using a relatively small number of peptides we can counter this information loss. We computationally tested this method with a well-characterized simple microbial community consisting of two species.},

	abstract = {(13)C-metabolic flux analysis ((13)C-MFA) has become a key method for metabolic engineering and systems biology. In the most common methodology, fluxes are calculated by global isotopomer balancing and iterative fitting to stationary (13)C-labeling data. This approach requires a closed carbon balance, long-lasting metabolic steady state, and the detection of (13)C-patterns in a large number of metabolites. These restrictions mostly reduced the application of (13)C-MFA to the central carbon metabolism of well-studied model organisms grown in minimal media with a single carbon source. Here we introduce non-stationary (13)C-metabolic flux ratio analysis as a novel method for (13)C-MFA to allow estimating local, relative fluxes from ultra-short (13)C-labeling experiments and without the need for global isotopomer balancing. The approach relies on the acquisition of non-stationary (13)C-labeling data exclusively for metabolites in the proximity of a node of converging fluxes and a local parameter estimation with a system of ordinary differential equations. We developed a generalized workflow that takes into account reaction types and the availability of mass spectrometric data on molecular ions or fragments for data processing, modeling, parameter and error estimation. We demonstrated the approach by analyzing three key nodes of converging fluxes in central metabolism of Bacillus subtilis. We obtained flux estimates that are in agreement with published results obtained from steady state experiments, but reduced the duration of the necessary (13)C-labeling experiment to less than a minute. These results show that our strategy enables to formally estimate relative pathway fluxes on extremely short time scale, neglecting cellular carbon balancing. Hence this approach paves the road to targeted (13)C-MFA in dynamic systems with multiple carbon sources and towards rich media.},

Infection with HCMV markedly upregulated flux through much of the central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis. Particularly notable increases occurred in flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its efflux to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis suppressed the replication of both HCMV and influenza A, another enveloped virus. These results show that fatty acid synthesis is essential for the replication of two divergent enveloped viruses and that systems-level metabolic flux profiling can identify metabolic targets for antiviral therapy.},

Resulting plots of unlabeled compound versus time follow variants of exponential decay, with the flux equal to the decay rate multiplied by the intracellular metabolite concentration. Because labeling is typically fast (t(1/2){\textless}or=5 min for central metabolites in Escherichia coli), variations on this approach can effectively probe dynamically changing metabolic fluxes. This protocol is exemplified using E. coli and nitrogen labeling, for which quantitative flux data for approximately 15 metabolites can be obtained over 3 d of work.

	abstract = {Current limitations in quantitatively predicting biological behavior hinder our efforts to engineer biological systems to produce biofuels and other desired chemicals. Here, we present a new method for calculating metabolic fluxes, key targets in metabolic engineering, that incorporates data from 13C labeling experiments and genome-scale models. The data from 13C labeling experiments provide strong flux constraints that eliminate the need to assume an evolutionary optimization principle such as the growth rate optimization assumption used in Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This effective constraining is achieved by making the simple but biologically relevant assumption that flux flows from core to peripheral metabolism and does not flow back. The new method is significantly more robust than FBA with respect to errors in genome-scale model reconstruction. Furthermore, it can provide a comprehensive picture of metabolite balancing and predictions for unmeasured extracellular fluxes as constrained by 13C labeling data. A comparison shows that the results of this new method are similar to those found through 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C MFA) for central carbon metabolism but, additionally, it provides flux estimates for peripheral metabolism. The extra validation gained by matching 48 relative labeling measurements is used to identify where and why several existing COnstraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) flux prediction algorithms fail. We demonstrate how to use this knowledge to refine these methods and improve their predictive capabilities. This method provides a reliable base upon which to improve the design of biological systems.},

	abstract = {Soil microbial diversity represents the largest global reservoir of novel microorganisms and enzymes. In this study, we coupled functional metagenomics and DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using multiple plant-derived carbon substrates and diverse soils to characterize active soil bacterial communities and their glycoside hydrolase genes, which have value for industrial applications. We incubated samples from three disparate Canadian soils (tundra, temperate rainforest, and agricultural) with five native carbon (12C) or stable-isotope-labeled (13C) carbohydrates (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, and cellulose). Indicator species analysis revealed high specificity and fidelity for many uncultured and unclassified bacterial taxa in the heavy DNA for all soils and substrates. Among characterized taxa, Actinomycetales (Salinibacterium), Rhizobiales (Devosia), Rhodospirillales (Telmatospirillum), and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium and Asticcacaulis) were bacterial indicator species for the heavy substrates and soils tested. Both Actinomycetales and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium) were associated with metabolism of cellulose, and Alphaproteobacteria were associated with the metabolism of arabinose; members of the order Rhizobiales were strongly associated with the metabolism of xylose. Annotated metagenomic data suggested diverse glycoside hydrolase gene representation within the pooled heavy DNA. By screening 2,876 cloned fragments derived from the 13C-labeled DNA isolated from soils incubated with cellulose, we demonstrate the power of combining DNA-SIP, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), and functional metagenomics by efficiently isolating multiple clones with activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and fluorogenic proxy substrates for carbohydrate-active enzymes.
IMPORTANCE The ability to identify genes based on function, instead of sequence homology, allows the discovery of genes that would not be identified through sequence alone. This is arguably the most powerful application of metagenomics for the recovery of novel genes and a natural partner of the stable-isotope-probing approach for targeting active-yet-uncultured microorganisms. We expanded on previous efforts to combine stable-isotope probing and metagenomics, enriching microorganisms from multiple soils that were active in degrading plant-derived carbohydrates, followed by construction of a cellulose-based metagenomic library and recovery of glycoside hydrolases through functional metagenomics. The major advance of our study was the discovery of active-yet-uncultivated soil microorganisms and enrichment of their glycoside hydrolases. We recovered positive cosmid clones in a higher frequency than would be expected with direct metagenomic analysis of soil DNA. This study has generated an invaluable metagenomic resource that future research will exploit for genetic and enzymatic potential.},

For the development and validation of our monitoring approach, fecal microbiota were analyzed with stable-isotope-labeled glucose used as the sole carbon source. In order to link the metabolic information and the microbial variability, we performed metabolic–microbial correlation analysis based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiles and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints, which successfully identified the glucose-utilizing bacteria and their related extracellular metabolites. Moreover, our approach revealed information regarding the carbon flux, in that the “first” wave of extracellular metabolites secreted by the glucose-utilizing bacteria were incorporated into the “secondary” group of substrate-utilizing bacteria, and that this “secondary” group further produced their own secondary metabolized substrates. Thus, this approach is a powerful tool for monitoring the metabolic dynamics in microbial ecosystems and allows for the tracking of the carbon flux within a microbial community.},

Being continuously developed since two decades, the technology made major contributions to the quantitative characterization of organisms in all fields of biotechnology and health-related research. 13C MFA, however, stands out from other “-omics sciences,” in that it requires not only experimental-analytical data, but also mathematical models and a computational toolset to infer the quantities of interest, i.e., the metabolic fluxes. At present, these models cannot be conveniently exchanged between different labs. Here, we present the implementation-independent model description language FluxML for specifying 13C MFA models. The core of FluxML captures the metabolic reaction network together with atom mappings, constraints on the model parameters, and the wealth of data configurations. In particular, we describe the governing design processes that shaped the FluxML language. We demonstrate the utility of FluxML to represent many contemporary experimental-analytical requirements in the field of 13C MFA. The major aim of FluxML is to offer a sound, open, and future-proof language to unambiguously express and conserve all the necessary information for model re-use, exchange, and comparison. Along with FluxML, several powerful computational tools are supplied for easy handling, but also to maintain a maximum of flexibility. Altogether, the FluxML collection is an “all-around carefree package” for 13C MFA modelers. We believe that FluxML improves scientific productivity as well as transparency and therewith contributes to the efficiency and reproducibility of computational modeling efforts in the field of 13C MFA.},

As a final quantitative endpoint of all cellular interactions, the intracellular fluxes are of immense interest in fundamental as well as applied research. Unlike the quantities of interest in most omics levels, in vivo fluxes are, however, not directly measureable. In the last decade, 13C-based metabolic flux analysis emerged as the state-of-the-art technique to infer steady-state fluxes by data from labeling experiments and the use of mathematical models. A very promising new area in systems metabolic engineering research is non-stationary 13C-metabolic flux analysis at metabolic steady-state conditions. Several studies have demonstrated an information surplus contained in transient labeling data compared to those taken at the isotopic equilibrium, as it is classically done. Enabled by recent, fairly multi-disciplinary progress, the new method opens several attractive options to (1) generate new insights, e.g., in cellular storage metabolism or the dilution of tracer by endogenous pools and (2) shift limits, inherent in the classical approach, towards enhanced applicability with respect to cultivation conditions and biological systems. We review the new developments in metabolome-based non-stationary 13C flux analysis and outline future prospects for accurate in vivo flux measurement.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is presented using cytosolic metabolite pool sizes and their 13C labeling data from an isotopically non-stationary 13C labeling experiment (INST-CLE). The procedure is demonstrated with an E. coli wild type strain grown at fed batch conditions. The intra cellular labeling dynamics are excited by a sudden step increase of the 13C portion in the substrate feed. Due to unchanged saturation of the substrate uptake system, the metabolic fluxes remain constant during the following sampling time period of only 16s, in which 20 samples are taken by an automated rapid sampling device immediately stopping metabolism by methanol quenching. Subsequent cell disruptive sample preparation and LC–MS/MS enabled simultaneous determination of pool sizes and mass isotopomers of intra cellular metabolites requiring detection limits in the nM range. Based on this data the new computational flux analysis tool 13CFLUX/INST is used to determine the intra cellular fluxes based on a complex carbon labeling network model. The measured data is in good agreement with the model predictions, thus proving the applicability of the new isotopically non-stationary 13C metabolic flux analysis (INST-13C-MFA) concept. Moreover, it is shown that significant new information with respect to flux identifiability, non-measurable pool sizes, data consistency, or large storage pools can be taken from the novel kind of experimental data. This offers new insight into the biological operation of the metabolic network in vivo.},

In this work, we demonstrate the COMPLETE-MFA approach using all singly labeled glucose tracers, [1-13C], [2-13C], [3-13C], [4-13C], [5-13C], and [6-13C]glucose to determine precise metabolic fluxes for wild-type Escherichia coli. Cells were grown in six parallel cultures on defined medium with glucose as the only carbon source. Mass isotopomers of biomass amino acids were measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The data from all six experiments were then fitted simultaneously to a single flux model to determine accurate intracellular fluxes. We obtained a statistically acceptable fit with more than 300 redundant measurements. The estimated flux map is the most precise flux result obtained thus far for E. coli cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that six isotopic labeling experiments have been successfully integrated for high-resolution 13C-flux analysis.},

Isotopically nonstationary 13C metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA), which is based on transient labeling studies at metabolic steady state, offers a comprehensive platform to quantify plant central metabolism. In this chapter, we describe the application of INST-MFA to investigate metabolism in leaves. Leaves are an autotrophic tissue, assimilating CO2 over a diurnal period implying that the metabolic steady state is limited to less than 12 h and thus requiring an INST-MFA approach. This strategy results in a comprehensive unified description of photorespiration, Calvin cycle, sucrose and starch synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic fluxes. We present protocols of the experimental aspects for labeling studies: transient 13CO2 labeling of leaf tissue, sample quenching and extraction, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of isotopic labeling data, measurement of sucrose and amino acids in vascular exudates, and provide details on the computational flux estimation using INST-MFA.},

Non-stationary 13C-MFA uses short-time isotopic transient data instead of long-time isotopic equilibrium data and thus is capable to resolve fluxes within much shorter labeling experiments. However, a comparison of both methods with data from one single experiment has not been made so far. In order to create a consistent database for directly comparing both methods a 13C-labeling experiment in a fed-batch cultivation with a Corynebacterium glutamicum lysine producer was carried out. During the experiment the substrate glucose was switched from unlabeled to a specifically labeled glucose mixture which was immediately traced by fast sampling and metabolite quenching. The time course of labeling enrichments in intracellular metabolites until isotopic stationarity was monitored by LC–MS/MS. The resulting dataset was evaluated using the classical as well as the isotopic non-stationary MFA approach. The results show that not only the obtained relative data, i.e. intracellular flux distributions, but also the more informative quantitative fluxome data significantly depend on the combination of the measurements and the underlying modeling approach used for data integration. Taking further criteria on the experimental and computational part into consideration, the current limitations of both methods are demonstrated and possible pitfalls are concluded.},

INST-MFA offers short-time experiments with a maximal information gain, and can moreover be applied to a wider range of growth conditions or organisms. Some of these conditions are not accessible by conventional methods. This comes at the price of significant methodological complexity involving high-frequency sampling and quenching, precise analysis of many samples and an extraordinary computational effort. This review gives a brief overview of basic principles, experimental workflows, and recent progress in this field. Special emphasis is laid on the trade-off between total effort and information gain, particularly on the suitability of INST-MFA for certain types of biological questions.

To evaluate 13C-metabolic flux maps for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an original experimental framework was designed allowing rapid, reliable collection of high-quality isotopomer data against time. It involved (i) a short-time 13C labeling injection device based on mixing control in a torus-shaped photobioreactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics allowing a sudden step-change in the 13C proportion in the substrate feed and (ii) a rapid sampling procedure using an automatic fast filtration method coupled to a manual rapid liquid nitrogen quenching step. 13C-substrate labeling enrichment was controlled through the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the pulsed solution. First results were obtained from steady-state continuous culture measurements allowing the characterization of the kinetics of label incorporation into light-limited growing cells cultivated in a photobioreactor operating at the maximal biomass productivity for an incident photon flux density of 200 µmol m−2 s−1. 13C label incorporation was measured for 21 intracellular metabolites using IC-MS/MS in 58 samples collected across a labeling experiment duration of 7 min. The fastest labeling rate was observed for 2/3-phosphoglycerate with an apparent isotopic stationary state reached after 300 s. The labeling rate was consistent with the optimized mixing time of about 4.9 s inside the reactor and the shortest reliable sampling period assessed at 5 s. Biotechnol.

	abstract = {Typically, 13C flux analysis relies on assumptions of both metabolic and isotopic steady state. If metabolism is steady but isotope labeling is not allowed to fully equilibrate, isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) can be used to estimate fluxes. This requires solution of differential equations that describe the time-dependent labeling of network metabolites, while iteratively adjusting the flux and pool size parameters to match the transient labeling measurements. INST-MFA holds a number of unique advantages over approaches that rely solely upon steady-state isotope enrichments. First, INST-MFA can be applied to estimate fluxes in autotrophic systems, which consume only single-carbon substrates. Second, INST-MFA is ideally suited to systems that label slowly due to the presence of large intermediate pools or pathway bottlenecks. Finally, INST-MFA provides increased measurement sensitivity to estimate reversible exchange fluxes and metabolite pool sizes, which represents a potential framework for integrating metabolomic analysis with 13C flux analysis. This review highlights the unique capabilities of INST-MFA, describes newly available software tools that automate INST-MFA calculations, presents several practical examples of recent INST-MFA applications, and discusses the technical challenges that lie ahead.},

The methodology has been termed COMPLETE-MFA, short for complementary parallel labeling experiments technique for metabolic flux analysis. In this contribution, we have tested the limits of COMPLETE-MFA by demonstrating integrated analysis of 14 parallel labeling experiments with Escherichia coli. An effort on such a massive scale has never been attempted before. In addition to several widely used isotopic tracers such as [1,2-13C]glucose and mixtures of [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose, four novel tracers were applied in this study: [2,3-13C]glucose, [4,5,6-13C]glucose, [2,3,4,5,6-13C]glucose and a mixture of [1-13C]glucose and [4,5,6-13C]glucose. This allowed us for the first time to compare the performance of a large number of isotopic tracers. Overall, there was no single best tracer for the entire E. coli metabolic network model. Tracers that produced well-resolved fluxes in the upper part of metabolism (glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways) showed poor performance for fluxes in the lower part of metabolism (TCA cycle and anaplerotic reactions), and vice versa. The best tracer for upper metabolism was 80\% [1-13C]glucose+20\% [U-13C]glucose, while [4,5,6-13C]glucose and [5-13C]glucose both produced optimal flux resolution in the lower part of metabolism. COMPLETE-MFA improved both flux precision and flux observability, i.e. more independent fluxes were resolved with smaller confidence intervals, especially exchange fluxes. Overall, this study demonstrates that COMPLETE-MFA is a powerful approach for improving flux measurements and that this methodology should be considered in future studies that require very high flux resolution.},

	abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system variables without any loss of information. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called EMUs, form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer methods, however, require significantly less computation time. For a typical 13C-labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway with 2H, 13C, and 18O tracers requires only 354 EMUs, compared to more than two million isotopomers.},

We applied elementary metabolite unit (EMU) theory to NMFA, dramatically reducing computational difficulty. We also introduced block decoupling, a new method that systematically and comprehensively divides EMU systems of equations into smaller subproblems to further reduce computational difficulty. These improvements led to a 5000-fold reduction in simulation times, enabling an entirely new and more complicated set of problems to be analyzed with NMFA. We simulated a series of nonstationary and stationary GC/MS measurements for a large E. coli network that was then used to estimate parameters and their associated confidence intervals. We found that fluxes could be successfully estimated using only nonstationary labeling data and external flux measurements. Addition of near-stationary and stationary time points increased the precision of most parameters. Contrary to prior reports, the precision of nonstationary estimates proved to be comparable to the precision of estimates based solely on stationary data. Finally, we applied EMU-based NMFA to experimental nonstationary measurements taken from brown adipocytes and successfully estimated fluxes and some metabolite concentrations. By using NFMA instead of traditional MFA, the experiment required only 6 h instead of 50 (the time necessary for most metabolite labeling to reach 99\% of isotopic steady state). Biotechnol.

In general, isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis requires three main components: (1) transient isotopic labeling experiments; (2) metabolite quenching and isotopomer analysis using LC-MS; (3) metabolic network construction and flux quantification. Labeling dynamics of key metabolites from 13C-pulse experiments allow flux estimation of key central pathways by solving ordinary differential equations to fit time-dependent isotopomer distribution data. Additionally, it is important to provide biomass requirements, carbon uptake rates, specific growth rates, and carbon excretion rates to properly and precisely balance the metabolic network. Labeling dynamics through cascade metabolites may also identify channeling phenomena in which metabolites are passed between enzymes without mixing with the bulk phase. In this chapter, we outline experimental protocols to probe metabolic pathways through dynamic labeling. We describe protocols for labeling experiments, metabolite quenching and extraction, LC-MS analysis, computational flux quantification, and metabolite channeling observations.},

We show that the often-used one- and two-compartment nonstochastic models allow explicit solutions from the corresponding stochastic differential equations. The resulting stochastic process is a Gaussian processes with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck covariance matrix. We applied the stochastic model to a large-scale data set from 15N labeling and compared its performance metrics with those of the nonstochastic curve fitting. The comparison showed that for more than 99\% of proteins, the stochastic model produced better fits to the experimental data (based on residual sum of squares). The model was used for extracting protein-decay rate constants from mouse brain (slow turnover) and liver (fast turnover) samples. We found that the most affected (compared to two-exponent curve fitting) results were those for liver proteins. The ratio of the median of degradation rate constants of liver proteins to those of brain proteins increased 4-fold in stochastic modeling compared to the two-exponent fitting. Stochastic modeling predicted stronger differences of protein turnover processes between mouse liver and brain than previously estimated. The model is independent of the labeling isotope. To show this, we also applied the model to protein turnover studied in induced heart failure in rats, in which metabolic labeling was achieved by administering heavy water. No changes in the model were necessary for adapting to heavy-water labeling. The approach has been implemented in a freely available R code.},

In recent years, the well-established 13C-MFA method based on metabolic and isotopic steady state was extended to INST-MFA (isotopically non-stationary MFA), which is performed in a transient labeling state. INST-MFA offers short-time experiments with a maximal information gain, and can moreover be applied to a wider range of growth conditions or organisms. Some of these conditions are not accessible by conventional methods. This comes at the price of significant methodological complexity involving high-frequency sampling and quenching, precise analysis of many samples and an extraordinary computational effort. This review gives a brief overview of basic principles, experimental workflows, and recent progress in this field. Special emphasis is laid on the trade-off between total effort and information gain, particularly on the suitability of INST-MFA for certain types of biological questions. In order to integrate INST-MFA as a viable method into the toolbox of MFA, some major challenges must be addressed in the coming years. These are discussed in the outlook.},

Adaptation to malate was rapid and primarily controlled posttranscriptionally compared with the slow, mainly transcriptionally controlled adaptation to glucose that entailed nearly half of the known transcription regulation network. Interactions across multiple levels of regulation were involved in adaptive changes that could also be achieved by controlling single genes. Our analysis suggests that global trade-offs and evolutionary constraints provide incentives to favor complex control programs.

The latter case is commonly constrained by the need to screen a large library of enzyme or pathway variants to identify those that can efficiently generate the desired compound. To address this limitation, we suggest the use of metabolic sensor strains which can grow only if the relevant compound is present and thus replace screening with direct selection. We used a computational platform to design metabolic sensor strains with varying dependencies on a specific compound. Our method systematically explores combinations of gene deletions and identifies how the growth requirement for a compound changes with the media composition. We demonstrate this approach by constructing a set of E. coli glycerate sensor strains. In each of these strains a different set of enzymes is disrupted such that central metabolism is effectively dissected into multiple segments, each requiring a dedicated carbon source. We find an almost perfect match between the predicted and experimental dependence on glycerate and show that the strains can be used to accurately detect glycerate concentrations across two orders of magnitude. Apart from demonstrating the potential application of metabolic sensor strains, our work reveals key phenomena in central metabolism, including spontaneous degradation of central metabolites and the importance of metabolic sinks for balancing small metabolic networks.},

The goal is to find the simplest scheme that fits the data, but there are many ways to connect even a small number of states ({\textgreater}2 million schemes with four open and four closed states). Many schemes make identical predictions. An exhaustive search over model space does not address the many equivalent schemes that will result. We have found a canonical form that can express all reaction schemes for binary channels. This form has the minimal number of rate constants for any rank (number of independent open-closed transitions), unlike other canonical forms such as the well established “uncoupled” scheme. Because all of the interconductance transitions in the new form are independent, we refer to it as the manifest interconductance rank (MIR) form. In the case of four open and four closed states, there are four MIR form schemes, corresponding to ranks 1-4. For many models proposed in the literature for specific ion channels, the equivalent MIR form has dramatically fewer links than the uncoupled form. By using the MIR form we prove that all rank 1 topologies with a given number of open and closed states make identical predictions in steady state, thus narrowing the search space for simple models. Moreover, we prove that fitting to canonical form preserves detailed balance. We also propose an efficient hierarchical algorithm for searching for the simplest possible model consistent with a given data set.},

Commonly, the different species in such consortia exhibit mutual metabolic dependencies that include the exchange of nutrients. Despite the global importance, surprisingly little is known about the metabolic interplay between species in particular subpopulations. To gain insight into the intracellular fluxes of subpopulations and their interplay within such mixed cultures, we developed here a 13C flux analysis approach based on affinity purification of the recombinant fusion glutathione S-transferase (GST) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter protein. Instead of detecting the 13C labeling patterns in the typically used amino acids from the total cellular protein, our method detects these 13C patterns in amino acids from the reporter protein that has been expressed in only one species of the consortium. As a proof of principle, we validated our approach by mixed-culture experiments of an Escherichia coli wild type with two metabolic mutants. The reporter method quantitatively resolved the expected mutant-specific metabolic phenotypes down to subpopulation fractions of about 1\%.},

	abstract = {How do intracellular fluxes respond to dynamically increasing glucose limitation when the physiology changes from strong overflow metabolism near to exclusively maintenance metabolism? Here we investigate this question in a typical industrial, glucose-limited fed-batch cultivation with a riboflavin overproducing Bacillus subtilis strain. To resolve dynamic flux changes, a novel approach to 13C flux analysis was developed that is based on recording 13C labeling patterns in free intracellular amino acids. Fluxes are then estimated with stationary flux ratio and iterative isotopomer balancing methods, for which a decomposition of the process into quasi-steady states and estimation of isotopic steady state 13C labeling patterns was necessary. By this approach, we achieve a temporal resolution of 30–60 min that allows us to resolve the slow metabolic transients that typically occur in such cultivations. In the late process phase we found, most prominently, almost exclusive respiratory metabolism, significantly increased pentose phosphate pathway contribution and a strongly decreased futile cycle through the PEP carboxykinase. As a consequence, higher catabolic NADPH formation occurred than was necessary to satisfy the anabolic demands, suggesting a transhydrogenase-like mechanism to close the balance of reducing equivalents.

Despite the importance of this phase, little is known about the metabolic state(s) that sustains it. Here, we investigate metabolically active but non-growing Bacillus subtilis during nitrogen starvation. In the absence of biomass formation as the major NADPH sink, the intracellular flux distribution in these resting B. subtilis reveals a large apparent catabolic NADPH overproduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 mmol·g−1·h−1 that was partly caused by high pentose phosphate pathway fluxes. Combining transcriptome analysis, stationary 13C-flux analysis in metabolic deletion mutants, 2H-labeling experiments, and kinetic flux profiling, we demonstrate that about half of the catabolic excess NADPH is oxidized by two transhydrogenation cycles, i.e. isoenzyme pairs of dehydrogenases with different cofactor specificities that operate in reverse directions. These transhydrogenation cycles were constituted by the combined activities of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases GapA/GapB and the malic enzymes MalS/YtsJ. At least an additional 6\% of the overproduced NADPH is reoxidized by continuous cycling between ana- and catabolism of glutamate. Furthermore, in vitro enzyme data show that a not yet identified transhydrogenase could potentially reoxidize ∼20\% of the overproduced NADPH. Overall, we demonstrate the interplay between several metabolic mechanisms that concertedly enable network-wide NADPH homeostasis under conditions of high catabolic NADPH production in the absence of cell growth in B. subtilis.},

In the field of 13C metabolic flux analysis, the most recent developments point toward recording labeling patterns by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS directly in intermediates in central carbon metabolism (CCM) to increase temporal resolution. Surprisingly, the flux studies published so far with LC-MS measurements were based on intact metabolic intermediates—thus neglected the potential benefits of using positional information to improve flux estimation. For the first time, we exploit collisional fragmentation to obtain more fine-grained 13C-data on intermediates of CCM and investigate their impact in 13C metabolic flux analysis. For the case study of Bacillus subtilis grown in mineral medium with 13C-labeled glucose, we compare the flux estimates obtained by iterative isotopologue balancing of 13C-data obtained either by LC-MS/MS for solely intact intermediates or LC-MS/MS for intact and fragmented intermediates of CCM. We show that with LC-MS/MS data, fragment information leads to more precise estimates of fluxes in pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Additionally, we present an efficient analytical strategy to rapidly acquire large sets of 13C-patterns by tandem MS, and an in-depth analysis of the collisional fragmentation of primary intermediates.

	abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using isotopic tracers aims at the experimental determination of in vivo reaction rates (fluxes). In recent years, the well-established 13C-MFA method based on metabolic and isotopic steady state was extended to INST-MFA (isotopically non-stationary MFA), which is performed in a transient labeling state. INST-MFA offers short-time experiments with a maximal information gain, and can moreover be applied to a wider range of growth conditions or organisms. Some of these conditions are not accessible by conventional methods. This comes at the price of significant methodological complexity involving high-frequency sampling and quenching, precise analysis of many samples and an extraordinary computational effort. This review gives a brief overview of basic principles, experimental workflows, and recent progress in this field. Special emphasis is laid on the trade-off between total effort and information gain, particularly on the suitability of INST-MFA for certain types of biological questions. In order to integrate INST-MFA as a viable method into the toolbox of MFA, some major challenges must be addressed in the coming years. These are discussed in the outlook.},

Both approaches combine metabolic network analysis based on pseudo steady-state (PSS) assumption for intracellular metabolism with dynamic models for extracellular environment. One strategy to capture dynamics is by combining network analysis with a kinetic model. Predictive models are thus established that can be used to optimize bioprocessing conditions and identify useful genetic manipulations. Alternatively, by combining network analysis with methods for analyzing extracellular time-series data, transients in intracellular metabolic fluxes can be determined and applied for process monitoring and control.},

Isotopically instationary 13C MFA under metabolic stationary conditions is a promising refinement of classical stationary MFA. It accounts for the experimental requirements of non-steady-state cultures as well as for the shortening of the experimental duration. This contribution extends all computational methods developed for classical stationary 13C MFA to the instationary situation by using high-performance computing methods. The developed tools allow for the simulation of instationary carbon labeling experiments (CLEs), sensitivity calculation with respect to unknown parameters, fitting of the model to the measured data, statistical identifiability analysis and an optimal experimental design facility. To explore the potential of the new approach all these tools are applied to the central metabolism of Escherichia coli. The achieved results are compared to the outcome of the stationary counterpart, especially focusing on statistical properties. This demonstrates the specific strengths of the instationary method. A new ranking method is proposed making both an a priori and an a posteriori design of the sampling times available. It will be shown that although still not all fluxes are identifiable, the quality of flux estimates can be strongly improved in the instationary case. Moreover, statements about the size of some immeasurable pool sizes can be made.},

Growth and metabolism of cyanobacteria are inherently tied to the diurnal rhythm of light availability. As yet, however, insight into the stoichiometric and energetic constraints of cyanobacterial diurnal growth is limited. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate the optimal allocation of cellular resources during diurnal phototrophic growth using a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We formulate phototrophic growth as an autocatalytic process and solve the resulting time-dependent resource allocation problem using constraint-based analysis. Based on a narrow and well-defined set of parameters, our approach results in an ab initio prediction of growth properties over a full diurnal cycle. The computational model allows us to study the optimality of metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth. The cyclic pattern of glycogen accumulation, an emergent property of the model, has timing characteristics that are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. The approach presented here provides insight into the time-dependent resource allocation problem of phototrophic diurnal growth and may serve as a general framework to assess the optimality of metabolic strategies that evolved in phototrophic organisms under diurnal conditions.},

Its kinetic and structural properties have been intensively studied for more than half a century. Yet important aspects of the catalytic mechanism remain poorly understood, especially the oxygenase reaction. Because of its relatively modest turnover rate (a few catalytic events per second) and the competitive inhibition by oxygen, Rubisco is often viewed as an inefficient catalyst for CO2 fixation. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving its catalytic efficiency, so far without success. In this review, we re-examine Rubisco's catalytic performance by comparison with other chemically related enzymes. We find that Rubisco is not especially slow. Furthermore, considering both the nature and the complexity of the chemical reaction, its kinetic properties are unremarkable. Although not unique to Rubisco, oxygenation is not systematically observed in enolate and enamine forming enzymes and cannot be considered as an inevitable consequence of the mechanism. It is more likely the result of a compromise between chemical and metabolic imperatives. We argue that a better description of Rubisco mechanism is still required to better understand the link between CO2 and O2 reactivity and the rationale of Rubisco diversification and evolution.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms provide a wealth of biodegradative potential in the reduction and elimination of xenobiotic compounds in the environment. One useful metric to evaluate potential biodegradation pathways is thermodynamic feasibility. However, experimental data for the thermodynamic properties of xenobiotics is scarce. The present work uses a group contribution method to study the thermodynamic properties of the University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database. The Gibbs free energies of formation and reaction are estimated for 914 compounds (81\%) and 902 reactions (75\%), respectively, in the database. The reactions are classified based on the minimum and maximum Gibbs free energy values, which accounts for uncertainty in the free energy estimates and a feasible concentration range relevant to biodegradation. Using the free energy estimates, the cumulative free energy change of 89 biodegradation pathways (51\%) in the database could be estimated. A comparison of the likelihood of the biotransformation rules in the Pathway Prediction System and their thermodynamic feasibility was then carried out. This analysis revealed that when evaluating the feasibility of biodegradation pathways, it is important to consider the thermodynamic topology of the reactions in the context of the complete pathway. Group contribution is shown to be a viable tool for estimating, a priori, the thermodynamic feasibility and the relative likelihood of alternative biodegradation reactions. This work offers a useful tool to a broad range of researchers interested in estimating the feasibility of the reactions in existing or novel biodegradation pathways. Biotechnol.

Cells must stabilize NADPH levels by increasing flux through replenishing metabolic pathways like pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Here, we investigate the mechanism enabling the rapid increase in NADPH supply by exposing Escherichia coli to hydrogen peroxide and quantifying the immediate metabolite dynamics. To systematically infer active regulatory interactions governing this response, we evaluated ensembles of kinetic models of glycolysis and PP pathway, each with different regulation mechanisms. Besides the known inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by ROS, we reveal the important allosteric inhibition of the first PP pathway enzyme by NADPH. This NADPH feedback inhibition maintains a below maximum-capacity PP pathway flux under non-stress conditions. Relieving this inhibition instantly increases PP pathway flux upon oxidative stress. We demonstrate that reducing cells' capacity to rapidly reroute their flux through the PP pathway increases their oxidative stress sensitivity.},

The oxygen-sensitive fluorophore responded to dissolved oxygen concentration, whereas the oxygen-insensitive one served as an internal reference. The sensor measured dissolved oxygen accurately in optically well-defined media. Oxygen transfer coefficients, kLa, were determined by a dynamic method in a commercial microtiter plate reader with an integrated shaker. For this purpose, the dissolved oxygen was initially depleted by the addition of sodium dithionite and, by oxygen transfer from air, it increased again after complete oxidation of dithionite. kLa values in one commercial reader were about 10 to 40 h−1. kLa values were inversely proportional to the filling volume and increased with increasing shaking intensity. Dissolved oxygen was monitored during cultivation of Corynebacterium glutamicum in another reader that allowed much higher shaking intensity. Growth rates determined from optical density measurement were identical to those observed in shaking flasks and in a stirred fermentor. Oxygen uptake rates measured in the stirred fermentor and dissolved oxygen concentrations measured during cultivation in the microtiter plate were used to estimate kLa values in a 96-well microtiter plate. The resulting values were about 130 h−1, which is in the lower range of typical stirred fermentors. The resulting maximum oxygen transfer rate was 26 mM h−1. Simulations showed that the errors caused by the intermittent measurement method were insignificant under the prevailing conditions. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Such persisters are well-described in antibiotic-treated bacterial populations. In this review, we compare mechanisms of drug persistence in bacteria and cancer. Both bacterial and cancer persisters are associated with slow-growing phenotypes, are metabolically distinct from non-persisters, and depend on the activation of specific regulatory programs. Moreover, evidence suggests that bacterial and cancer persisters are an important reservoir for the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. The emerging parallels between persistence in bacteria and cancer can guide efforts to untangle mechanistic links between growth, metabolism, and cellular regulation, and reveal exploitable therapeutic vulnerabilities.},

We find that the activity of the resulting synthetic pathway becomes possible due to the recalibration of steady-state concentrations of key metabolites, such that the in vivo cleavage rates of all three phosphoketolase substrates are similar.

Replacement of Asp206 with Leu, Gly, and Asn resulted in the loss of DAO activity and characteristic absorption spectrum for flavoenzyme, while the other mutant DAOs, Asp206Glu, Asp206Ser, and Asp206Ala, exhibited a similar spectral profile to that of wild-type enzyme and retained about 6–90\% of the enzyme activity.

These problems involve the solutions of transcendental equations that include products of variables and their logarithms. Such equations are solvable by the use of the Lambert W(x) function. Thus, these standard kinetics examples are solved in terms of W(x) to show the applicability of this commonly unknown function to the biochemical community.

Replacement of the chromosomalptsG gene with an insertionally inactivated form also restored growth on glucose and resulted in the same distribution of fermentation products. The physiological characteristics of the spontaneous and null mutants were consistent with loss of function of the ptsG gene product; the mutants possessed greatly reduced glucose phosphotransferase activity and lacked normal glucose repression. Introduction of the null mutant into strains not blocked in the ability to ferment glucose also increased succinate production in those strains.

	abstract = {Introduction PaDEL-Descriptor is a software for calculating molecular descriptors and fingerprints. The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 1D, 2D descriptors, and 134 3D descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors, McGowan volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and Roth. Methods PaDEL-Descriptor was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a Master/Worker pattern to take advantage of the multiple CPU cores that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular descriptors. Results The software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is multithreaded.

Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype–phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

These models include all known metabolic reactions based on the genome annotation. However, the reactions that are active are dependent on the cellular metabolic function or environmental condition. Constraint-based methods that integrate condition-specific transcriptomics data into models have been used extensively to investigate condition-specific metabolism. Here, we present a method (TEX-FBA) for modeling condition-specific metabolism that combines transcriptomics and reaction thermodynamics data to generate a thermodynamically-feasible condition-specific metabolic model. TEX-FBA is an extension of thermodynamic-based flux balance analysis (TFA), which allows the simultaneous integration of different stages of experimental data (e.g., absolute gene expression, metabolite concentrations, thermodynamic data, and fluxomics) and the identification of alternative metabolic states that maximize consistency between gene expression levels and condition-specific reaction fluxes. We applied TEX-FBA to a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli by integrating available condition-specific experimental data and found a marked reduction in the flux solution space. Our analysis revealed a marked correlation between actual gene expression profile and experimental flux measurements compared to the one obtained from a randomly generated gene expression profile. We identified additional essential reactions from the membrane lipid and folate metabolism when we integrated transcriptomics data of the given condition on the top of metabolomics and thermodynamics data. These results show TEX-FBA is a promising new approach to study condition-specific metabolism when different types of experimental data are available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This metabolic flux ratio analysis by GC-MS provides a comprehensive perspective on central metabolism by quantifying 14 ratios of fluxes through converging pathways and reactions from [1- 13 C] and [U- 13 C]glucose experiments. Reliability and accuracy of this method were experimentally verified by successfully capturing expected flux responses of Escherichia coli to environmental modifications and seven knockout mutations in all major pathways of central metabolism. Furthermore, several mutants exhibited additional, unexpected flux responses that provide new insights into the behavior of the metabolic network in its entirety. Most prominently, the low in vivo activity of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in wild-type E. coli increased up to a contribution of 30\% to glucose catabolism in mutants of glycolysis and TCA cycle. Moreover, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase mutants catabolized glucose not exclusively via glycolysis, suggesting a yet unidentified bypass of this reaction. Although strongly affected by environmental conditions, a stable balance between anaplerotic and TCA cycle flux was maintained by all mutants in the upper part of metabolism. Overall, our results provide quantitative insight into flux changes that bring about the resilience of metabolic networks to disruption.},

Surprisingly, this prediction was never tested experimentally nor was it scrutinized using modern theoretical tools. Here we show that unbinding may also speed up enzymatic turnover—turning a spotlight to the fact that its actual role in enzymatic catalysis remains to be determined experimentally. Analytically constructing the unbinding phase space, we identify four distinct categories of unbinding: inhibitory, excitatory, superexcitatory, and restorative. A transition in which the effect of unbinding changes from inhibitory to excitatory as substrate concentrations increase, and an overlooked tradeoff between the speed and efficiency of enzymatic reactions, are naturally unveiled as a result. The theory presented herein motivates, and allows the interpretation of, groundbreaking experiments in which existing single-molecule manipulation techniques will be adapted for the purpose of measuring enzymatic turnover under a controlled variation of unbinding rates. As we hereby show, these experiments will not only shed first light on the role of unbinding but will also allow one to determine the time distribution required for the completion of the catalytic step in isolation from the rest of the enzymatic turnover cycle.},

Metabolicnetwork reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured databases of biochemical reactions and metabolites. They contain information such as exact reaction stoichiometry, reaction reversibility, and the relationships between genes, proteins, and reactions. Network reconstructions have been used extensively to study the phenotypic behavior of wild-type and mutant stains under a variety of conditions, linking genotypes with phenotypes. Such phenotypic simulations have allowed for the prediction of growth after genetic manipulations, prediction of growth phenotypes after adaptive evolution, and prediction of essential genes. Additionally, because network reconstructions are organism specific, they can be used to understand differences between organisms of species in a functional context.There are different types of reconstructions representing various types of biological networks (metabolic, regulatory, transcription/translation). This chapter serves as an introduction to metabolic and regulatory network reconstructions and models and gives a complete description of the core Escherichia coli metabolic model. This model can be analyzed in any computational format (such as MATLAB or Mathematica) based on the information given in this chapter. The core E. coli model is a small-scale model that can be used for educational purposes. It is meant to be used by senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students learning about constraint-based modeling and systems biology. This model has enough reactions and pathways to enable interesting and insightful calculations, but it is also simple enough that the results of such calculations can be understoodeasily.},

However, major issues, both in the experimental set-up and in the accompanying numerical methods currently limit the application of this approach. Here, we propose a method to apply novel types of label inputs, sinusoidal or more generally periodic label inputs, to address both the practical and numerical challenges of dynamic labeling experiments. By considering a simple metabolic system, i.e. a linear, non-reversible pathway of arbitrary length, we develop mathematical descriptions of label propagation for both classical and novel label inputs. Theoretical developments and computer simulations show that the application of rectangular periodic pulses has both numerical and practical advantages over other approaches. We applied the strategy to estimate fluxes in a simulated experiment performed on a complex metabolic network (the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli), to further demonstrate its value in conditions which are close to those in real experiments. This study provides a theoretical basis for the rational interpretation of label propagation curves in real experiments, and will help identify the strengths, pitfalls and limitations of such experiments. The cases described here can also be used as test cases for more general numerical methods aimed at identifying network topology, analyzing metabolic fluxes or measuring concentrations of metabolites.},

These compounds may range from electrons or hydrogen in biofuel cell and environmental applications to complex drug precursor molecules. A comprehensive database of biotransformations, referred to as the Universal database (with {\textgreater}5700 reactions), is compiled and regularly updated by downloading and curating reactions from multiple biopathway database sources. Combinatorial optimization is then used to elucidate the set(s) of non-native functionalities, extracted from this Universal database, to add to the examined production host for enabling the desired product formation. Subsequently, competing functionalities that divert flux away from the targeted product are identified and removed to ensure higher product yields coupled with growth. This work represents an advancement over earlier efforts by establishing an integrated computational framework capable of constructing stoichiometrically balanced pathways, imposing maximum product yield requirements, pinpointing the optimal substrate(s), and evaluating different microbial hosts. The range and utility of OptStrain are demonstrated by addressing two very different product molecules. The hydrogen case study pinpoints reaction elimination strategies for improving hydrogen yields using two different substrates for three separate production hosts. In contrast, the vanillin study primarily showcases which non-native pathways need to be added into Escherichia coli. In summary, OptStrain provides a useful tool to aid microbial strain design and, more importantly, it establishes an integrated framework to accommodate future modeling developments.},

	abstract = {An optimization-based procedure for studying the response of metabolic networks after gene knockouts or additions is introduced and applied to a linear flux balance analysis (FBA) Escherichia coli model. Both the gene addition problem of optimally selecting which foreign genes to recombine into E. coli, as well as the gene deletion problem of removing a given number of existing ones, are formulated as mixed-integer optimization problems using binary 0–1 variables. The developed modeling and optimization framework is tested by investigating the effect of gene deletions on biomass production and addressing the maximum theoretical production of the 20 amino acids for aerobic growth on glucose and acetate substrates. In the gene deletion study, the smallest gene set necessary to achieve maximum biomass production in E. coli is determined for aerobic growth on glucose. The subsequent gene knockout analysis indicates that biomass production decreases monotonically, rendering the metabolic network incapable of growth after only 18 gene deletions. In the gene addition study, the E. coli flux balance model is augmented with 3,400 non-E. coli reactions from the KEGG database to form a multispecies model. This model is referred to as the Universal model. This study reveals that the maximum theoretical production of six amino acids could be improved by the addition of only one or two genes to the native amino acid production pathway of E. coli, even though the model could choose from 3,400 foreign reaction candidates. Specifically, manipulation of the arginine production pathway showed the most promise with 8.75\% and 9.05\% predicted increases with the addition of genes for growth on glucose and acetate, respectively. The mechanism of all suggested enhancements is either by: 1) improving the energy efficiency and/or 2) increasing the carbon conversion efficiency of the production route. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Under different environmental stresses, bacteria optimize the allocation of cellular resources through a variety of mechanisms. Recently, researchers have used phenomenological models to quantitatively characterize the allocation of bacterial protein resources under metabolic and translational limitations. Some stresses interfere with protein maturation, thereby enhancing the expression of chaperones and proteases. However, the reallocation of protein resources caused by such environmental stresses has not been modeled quantitatively. Here, we developed a dynamic model of coarse-grained protein resource fluxes based on a self-replicator that includes protein maturation and degradation. Through flux balance analysis, it produces a constrained optimization problem that can be solved analytically. Accordingly, we predicted protein allocation fractions as functions of growth rate under different limitations, which are basically in line with empirical data. We cultured Escherichia coli in media containing different concentrations of chloramphenicol, acetic acid, and paraquat and measured the functional relationship between the expression level of β-galactosidase driven by a constitutive promoter and the bacterial growth rate, respectively. Taking into account the possible mode of stress limitation on the fluxes, our model reproduces this experimentally measured relationship. In addition, our model is in good agreement with the experimental relationship between growth rate and proteome fraction of unnecessary protein in E. coli, considering the unoptimized upregulation of chaperones with useless protein overexpression. The results provide a more systematic view of bacterial stress adaptation that may help in designing for bioengineering or medical interventions.},

New methods to generate genome sequences illuminate the identity of organisms and their metabolic capacities, placing them in community and ecosystem contexts7,8. Here, we use new genomic data from over 1,000 uncultivated and little known organisms, together with published sequences, to infer a dramatically expanded version of the tree of life, with Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya included. The depiction is both a global overview and a snapshot of the diversity within each major lineage. The results reveal the dominance of bacterial diversification and underline the importance of organisms lacking isolated representatives, with substantial evolution concentrated in a major radiation of such organisms.

To break down organismal fitness into molecular contributions, costs and benefits of cellular components must be analyzed in all phases of the organism’s life cycle. Here, we establish the required quantitative approach for the death phase of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We show that in carbon starvation, an exponential decay of viability emerges as a collective phenomenon, with viable cells recycling nutrients from cell carcasses to maintain viability. The observed collective death rate is determined by the maintenance rate of viable cells and the amount of nutrients recovered from dead cells. Using this relation, we study the cost of a wasteful enzyme during starvation and the benefit of the stress response sigma factor RpoS. While the enzyme increases maintenance and thereby the death rate, RpoS improves biomass recycling, decreasing the death rate. Our approach thus enables quantitative analyses of how cellular components affect the survival of non-growing cells.},

	abstract = {Metabolic engineering is a critical biotechnological approach in addressing global energy and environment challenges. Most engineering efforts, however, consist of laborious and inefficient trial-and-error of target pathways, due in part to the lack of methodologies that can comprehensively assess pathway properties in thermodynamics and kinetics. Metabolic engineering can benefit from computational tools that evaluate feasibility, expense and stability of non-natural metabolic pathways. Such tools can also help us understand natural pathways and their regulation at systems level. Here we introduce a computational toolbox, PathParser, which, for the first time, integrates multiple important functions for pathway analysis including thermodynamics analysis, kinetics-based protein cost optimization and robustness analysis. Specifically, PathParser enables optimization of the driving force of a pathway by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of least thermodynamically favorable reaction. In addition, based on reaction thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics, it can compute the minimal enzyme protein cost that supports metabolic flux, and evaluate pathway stability and flux in response to enzyme concentration perturbations. In a demo analysis of the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and photorespiration pathway in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, the computation results are corroborated by experimental proteomics data as well as metabolic engineering outcomes.

First, E. coli and Synechocystis metabolomic and fluxomic data were combined with metabolic models to identify thermodynamic constraints on metabolite concentrations (NET analysis). Then, thousands of automatically constructed pathways were placed within each network and subjected to a network-embedded variant of the max-min driving force analysis (NEM). We found that the networks had different capabilities for imparting thermodynamic driving forces toward certain compounds. Key metabolites were constrained differently in Synechocystis due to opposing flux directions in glycolysis and carbon fixation, the forked tri-carboxylic acid cycle, and photorespiration. Furthermore, the lysine biosynthesis pathway in Synechocystis was identified as thermodynamically constrained, impacting both endogenous and heterologous reactions through low 2-oxoglutarate levels. Our study also identified important yet poorly covered areas in existing metabolomics data and provides a reference for future thermodynamics-based engineering in Synechocystis and beyond. The POPPY methodology represents a step in making optimal pathway-host matches, which is likely to become important as the practical range of host organisms is diversified.},

We addressed this question by first employing a variant of the optStoic algorithm to exhaustively identify over 11,916 possible routes between glucose and pyruvate at different pre-determined stoichiometric yields of ATP. Subsequently, we analyzed the thermodynamic feasibility of all the pathways at physiological metabolite concentrations and quantified the protein cost of the feasible solutions. Pareto optimality analysis between energy efficiency and protein cost reveals that the naturally evolved ED and EMP pathways are indeed among the most protein cost-efficient pathways in their respective ATP yield categories and remain thermodynamically feasible across a wide range of ATP/ADP ratios and pathway intermediate metabolite concentration ranges. In contrast, pathways with higher ATP yield ({\textgreater}2) while feasible, are bound within stringent and often extreme operability ranges of cofactor and intermediate metabolite concentrations. The preponderance of EMP and ED is thus consistent with not only optimally balancing energy yield vs. enzyme cost but also with ensuring operability for wide metabolite concentration ranges and ATP/ADP ratios.},

To further improve their accuracy, recent methodological developments focused on integration of thermodynamic information in metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions by thermodynamic driving forces. Here we present OptMDFpathway, a method that extends the recently proposed framework of Max-min Driving Force (MDF) for thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, OptMDFpathway identifies both the optimal MDF for a desired phenotypic behavior as well as the respective pathway itself that supports the optimal driving force. OptMDFpathway is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks. As an important theoretical result, we also show that there exists always at least one elementary mode in the network that reaches the maximal MDF. We employed our new approach to systematically identify all substrate-product combinations in Escherichia coli where product synthesis allows for concomitant net CO2 assimilation via thermodynamically feasible pathways. Although biomass synthesis cannot be coupled to net CO2 fixation in E. coli we found that as many as 145 of the 949 cytosolic carbon metabolites contained in the genome-scale model iJO1366 enable net CO2 incorporation along thermodynamically feasible pathways with glycerol as substrate and 34 with glucose. The most promising products in terms of carbon assimilation yield and thermodynamic driving forces are orotate, aspartate and the C4-metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We also identified thermodynamic bottlenecks frequently limiting the maximal driving force of the CO2-fixing pathways. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like E. coli hold a possibly underestimated potential for CO2 assimilation which may complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO2. Furthermore, we envision that the developed OptMDFpathway approach can be used for many other applications within the framework of constrained-based modeling and for rational design of metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {Cells require energy for growth and maintenance and have evolved to have multiple pathways to produce energy in response to varying conditions. A basic question in this context is how cells organize energy metabolism, which is, however, challenging to elucidate due to its complexity, i.e., the energy-producing pathways overlap with each other and even intertwine with biomass formation pathways. Here, we propose a modeling concept that decomposes energy metabolism into biomass formation and ATP-producing pathways. The latter can be further decomposed into a high-yield and a low-yield pathway. This enables independent estimation of protein efficiency for each pathway. With this concept, we modeled energy metabolism for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that the high-yield pathway shows lower protein efficiency than the low-yield pathway. Taken together with a fixed protein constraint, we predict overflow metabolism in E. coli and the Crabtree effect in S. cerevisiae, meaning that energy metabolism is sufficient to explain the metabolic switches. The static protein constraint is supported by the findings that protein mass of energy metabolism is conserved across conditions based on absolute proteomics data. This also suggests that enzymes may have decreased saturation or activity at low glucose uptake rates. Finally, our analyses point out three ways to improve growth, i.e., increasing protein allocation to energy metabolism, decreasing ATP demand, or increasing activity for key enzymes.},

However, for several applications, smaller metabolic (core) models are needed. Using a recently introduced reduction algorithm and the latest E. coli genome-scale reconstruction iJO1366, we derived EColiCore2, a model of the central metabolism of E. coli. EColiCore2 is a subnetwork of iJO1366 and preserves predefined phenotypes including optimal growth on different substrates. The network comprises 486 metabolites and 499 reactions, is accessible for elementary-modes analysis and can, if required, be further compressed to a network with 82 reactions and 54 metabolites having an identical solution space as EColiCore2. A systematic comparison of EColiCore2 with its genome-scale parent model iJO1366 reveals that several key properties (flux ranges, reaction essentialities, production envelopes) of the central metabolism are preserved in EColiCore2 while it neglects redundancies along biosynthetic routes. We also compare calculated metabolic engineering strategies in both models and demonstrate, as a general result, how intervention strategies found in a core model allow the identification of valid strategies in a genome-scale model. Overall, EColiCore2 holds promise to become a reference model of E. coli’s central metabolism.},

Strains with severe growth defects displayed highly altered intracellular flux patterns and were the most difficult to predict using current constraint-based modeling approaches. In the ΔpfkA strain, an unexpected glucose-secretion phenotype was identified. The broad range of flux rewiring responses that were quantified suggest that some compensating pathways are more flexible than others, resulting in a more robust physiology. The fact that only 2 out of 20 strains displayed an increased net pathway-flux capacity points to a fundamental rate limitation of E. coli core metabolism.

Apart from optimizing biosynthesis pathways as standalone units, a successful bioengineering approach must bend the endogenous metabolic network of the host, and especially its central metabolism, to support the bioproduction process. In practice, this usually involves three complementary strategies which include tuning-down or abolishing competing metabolic pathways, increasing the availability of precursors of the desired biosynthesis pathway, and ensuring high availability of energetic resources such as ATP and NADPH. In this review, we explore these strategies, focusing on key metabolic pathways and processes, such as glycolysis, anaplerosis, the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, and NADPH production. We show that only a holistic approach for bioengineering — considering the metabolic network of the host organism as a whole, rather than focusing on the production pathway alone — can truly mold microorganisms into efficient biofactories.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial approaches in metabolic engineering work by generating genetic diversity in a microbial population followed by screening for strains with improved phenotypes. One of the most common goals in this field is the generation of a high rate chemical producing strain. A major hurdle with this approach is that many chemicals do not have easy to recognize attributes, making their screening expensive and time consuming. To address this problem, it was previously suggested to use microbial biosensors to facilitate the detection and quantification of chemicals of interest. Here, we present novel computational methods to: (i) rationally design microbial biosensors for chemicals of interest based on substrate auxotrophy that would enable their high-throughput screening; (ii) predict engineering strategies for coupling the synthesis of a chemical of interest with the production of a proxy metabolite for which high-throughput screening is possible via a designed bio-sensor. The biosensor design method is validated based on known genetic modifications in an array of E. coli strains auxotrophic to various amino-acids. Predicted chemical production rates achievable via the biosensor-based approach are shown to potentially improve upon those predicted by current rational strain design approaches. (A Matlab implementation of the biosensor design method is available via http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/{\textasciitilde}tomersh/tools).},

To investigate the raison d'être of this metabolic arrangement, the distribution of periplasmic and cytoplasmic carbon fluxes was studied in glucose cultures of this bacterium by using 13C-labeled substrates, combined with quantitative physiology experiments, metabolite quantification, and in vitro enzymatic assays under both saturating and non-saturating, quasi in vivo conditions. Metabolic flux analysis demonstrated that 90\% of the consumed sugar was converted into gluconate, entering central carbon metabolism as 6-phosphogluconate and further channeled into the ED pathway. Remarkably, about 10\% of the triose phosphates were found to be recycled back to form hexose phosphates. This set of reactions merges activities belonging to the ED, the EMP (operating in a gluconeogenic fashion), and the pentose phosphate pathways to form an unforeseen metabolic architecture (EDEMP cycle). Determination of the NADPH balance revealed that the default metabolic state of P. putida KT2440 is characterized by a slight catabolic overproduction of reducing power. Cells growing on glucose thus run a biochemical cycle that favors NADPH formation. Because NADPH is required not only for anabolic functions but also for counteracting different types of environmental stress, such a cyclic operation may contribute to the physiological heftiness of this bacterium in its natural habitats.},

The platform uses hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive/negative ion switching to analyze 258 metabolites (289 Q1/Q3 transitions) from a single 15-min liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry acquisition with a 3-ms dwell time and a 1.55-s duty cycle time.

Relative quantification can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total ion current can be used for statistical analyses and pathway analyses across biological sample conditions.

Yet, the evolutionary dynamics and physiological mechanisms of how such side activities contribute to systems-level adaptations are not well characterized. Furthermore, it remains untested whether knowledge of an organism's promiscuous reaction set, or underground metabolism, can aid in forecasting the genetic basis of metabolic adaptations. Here, we employ a computational model of underground metabolism and laboratory evolution experiments to examine the role of enzyme promiscuity in the acquisition and optimization of growth on predicted non-native substrates in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. After as few as approximately 20 generations, evolved populations repeatedly acquired the capacity to grow on five predicted non-native substrates?D-lyxose, D-2-deoxyribose, D-arabinose, m-tartrate, and monomethyl succinate. Altered promiscuous activities were shown to be directly involved in establishing high-efficiency pathways. Structural mutations shifted enzyme substrate turnover rates toward the new substrate while retaining a preference for the primary substrate. Finally, genes underlying the phenotypic innovations were accurately predicted by genome-scale model simulations of metabolism with enzyme promiscuity.},

	abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system variables without any loss of information. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called EMUs, form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer methods, however, require significantly less computation time. For a typical 13C-labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway with 2H, 13C, and 18O tracers requires only 354 EMUs, compared to more than two million isotopomers.},

	abstract = {The last few years have brought tremendous progress in experimental methods for metabolic flux determination by carbon-labeling experiments. A significant enlargement of the available measurement data set has been achieved, especially when isotopomer fractions within intracellular metabolite pools are quantitated. This information can be used to improve the statistical quality of flux estimates. Furthermore, several assumptions on bidirectional intracellular reaction steps that were hitherto indispensable may now become obsolete. To make full use of the complete measurement information a general mathematical model for isotopomer systems is established in this contribution. Then, by introducing the important new concept of cumomers and cumomer fractions, it is shown that the arising nonlinear isotopomer balance equations can be solved analytically in all cases. In particular, the solution of the metabolite flux balances and the positional carbon-labeling balances presented in part I of this series turn out to be just the first two steps of the general solution procedure for isotopomer balances. A detailed analysis of the isotopomer network structure then opens up new insights into the intrinsic structure of isotopomer systems. In particular, it turns out that isotopomer systems are not as complex as they appear at first glance. This enables some far-reaching conclusions to be drawn on the information potential of isotopomer experiments with respect to flux identification. Finally, some illustrative examples are examined to show that an information increase is not guaranteed when isotopomer measurements are used in addition to positional enrichment data. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The criteria that determine which pathways are selected remain unclear. One recurrent selection is overflow metabolism: the seemingly wasteful, simultaneous usage of an efficient and an inefficient pathway, shown for example in E. coli, S. cerevisiae and cancer cells. Many different models, based on different assumptions, can reproduce this observation. Therefore, they provide no conclusive evidence which mechanism is causing overflow metabolism. We compare the mathematical structure of these models. Although ranging from Flux Balance Analyses to self-fabricating Metabolism and Expression models, we could rewrite all models into one standard form. We conclude that all models predict overflow metabolism when two, model-specific, growth-limiting constraints are hit. This is consistent with recent theory. Thus, identifying these two constraints is essential for understanding overflow metabolism. We list all the imposed constraints by these models, so that they can hopefully be tested in future experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.},

In particular, intracellular metabolic systems are rationally regulated to maximize the cellular growth rate. Correspondingly, the field of microeconomics investigates the behavior of individuals assumed to act rationally to maximize their utility. Therefore, microeconomics can be applied to analyze the metabolic strategies of cells. Toward this end, we developed a microeconomics-based theory of cellular metabolism by precisely mapping the regulation of metabolic systems onto the theory of consumer choice in microeconomics. As a representative example, we focus on overflow metabolism, a seemingly wasteful strategy in which cells utilize fermentation instead of the more energetically efficient respiration (so-called Warburg effect in cancer). To resolve this apparent contradiction, we formulate overflow metabolism as an optimization problem of the allocation of carbon fluxes under the guidance of microeconomic theory. Accordingly, we demonstrate that over-flow metabolism corresponds to Giffen behavior in economics, the strange consumer behavior by which greater amounts of goods are consumed as their price increases. We reveal the general conditions required for both overflow metabolism and Giffen goods: trade-off and complementarity, i.e., the impossibility of substitution for different goods, among multiple objectives. Based on the correspondence with Giffen behavior, a counterintuitive response of metabolism against the leakage and degradation of intermediate metabolites, which corresponds to the change in the price of a consumer good, is predicted. Over-all, this demonstration highlights that application of microeconomics to metabolic systems will offer new predictions and potentially new paradigms for both biology and economics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, because of the limited availability of the reaction rate data for the left-hand side of the equation, many studies use changes in the amount of molecules in the right-hand side as a surrogate for the reaction rate. Recent advances in comprehensive measurement technologies enable to measure reaction rates in several omic layers. This allows attributing trans-omic network reconstruction to model the selection problem of differential equation-based models.

GEM-guided predictions of growth phenotypes rely on the accurate definition of a biomass objective function (BOF) that is designed to include key cellular biomass components such as the major macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins), lipids, coenzymes, inorganic ions and species-specific components. Despite its importance, no standardized computational platform is currently available to generate species-specific biomass objective functions in a data-driven, unbiased fashion. To fill this gap in the metabolic modeling software ecosystem, we implemented BOFdat, a Python package for the definition of a Biomass Objective Function from experimental data. BOFdat has a modular implementation that divides the BOF definition process into three independent modules defined here as steps: 1) the coefficients for major macromolecules are calculated, 2) coenzymes and inorganic ions are identified and their stoichiometric coefficients estimated, 3) the remaining species-specific metabolic biomass precursors are algorithmically extracted in an unbiased way from experimental data. We used BOFdat to reconstruct the BOF of the Escherichia coli model iML1515, a gold standard in the field. The BOF generated by BOFdat resulted in the most concordant biomass composition, growth rate, and gene essentiality prediction accuracy when compared to other methods.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The biological fitness of unicellular organisms is largely determined by their balanced growth rate, i.e., by the rate with which they replicate their biomass composition. Evolutionary optimization of this growth rate occurred under a set of physicochemical constraints, including mass conservation, reaction kinetics, and limits on dry mass per volume (cellular capacity). Mathematical models that account explicitly for these constraints are inevitably nonlinear, and their optimization has been restricted to small, non-realistic cell models. Here, we show that any balanced growth state can be represented as a weighted average of elementary flux modes (EFMs) of a corresponding flux balance problem, where maximal balanced growth under a single capacity constraint corresponds to a single EFM. For any balanced growth state that corresponds to an EFM of an arbitrarily sized model, we provide explicit expressions for individual protein concentrations, fluxes, and growth rate; all variables are uniquely determined by the concentrations of metabolites and total protein. We provide explicit and intuitively interpretable expressions for the marginal fitness costs and benefits of individual concentrations. At optimal balanced growth, the marginal net benefits of each metabolite concentration and of total protein concentration equal the marginal benefit of the cellular capacity. Based solely on physicochemical constraints, the balanced growth analysis (BGA) framework introduced here unveils fundamental quantitative principles of balanced cellular growth, quantifies the effect of cellular capacity on fitness, and leads to experimentally testable predictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Understanding the fundamental characteristics of microbial communities could have far reaching implications for human health and applied biotechnology. Despite this, much is still unknown regarding the genetic basis and evolutionary strategies underlying the formation of viable synthetic communities. By pairing auxotrophic mutants in co-culture, it has been demonstrated that viable nascent E. coli communities can be established where the mutant strains are metabolically coupled. A novel algorithm, OptAux, was constructed to design 61 unique multi-knockout E. coli auxotrophic strains that require significant metabolite uptake to grow. These predicted knockouts included a diverse set of novel non-specific auxotrophs that result from inhibition of major biosynthetic subsystems. Three OptAux predicted non-specific auxotrophic strains—with diverse metabolic deficiencies—were co-cultured with an L-histidine auxotroph and optimized via adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Time-course sequencing revealed the genetic changes employed by each strain to achieve higher community growth rates and provided insight into mechanisms for adapting to the syntrophic niche. A community model of metabolism and gene expression was utilized to predict the relative community composition and fundamental characteristics of the evolved communities. This work presents new insight into the genetic strategies underlying viable nascent community formation and a cutting-edge computational method to elucidate metabolic changes that empower the creation of cooperative communities.},

	abstract = {Despite our increasing topological knowledge on regulation networks in model bacteria, it is largely unknown which of the many co‐occurring regulatory events actually control metabolic function and the distribution of intracellular fluxes. Here, we unravel condition‐dependent transcriptional control of Escherichia coli metabolism by large‐scale 13C‐flux analysis in 91 transcriptional regulator mutants on glucose and galactose. In contrast to the canonical respiro‐fermentative glucose metabolism, fully respiratory galactose metabolism depends exclusively on the phosphoenol‐pyruvate (PEP)‐glyoxylate cycle. While 2/3 of the regulators directly or indirectly affected absolute flux rates, the partitioning between different pathways remained largely stable with transcriptional control focusing primarily on the acetyl‐CoA branch point. Flux distribution control was achieved by nine transcription factors on glucose, including ArcA, Fur, PdhR, IHF A and IHF B, but was exclusively mediated by the cAMP‐dependent Crp regulation of the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle flux on galactose. Five further transcription factors affected this flux only indirectly through cAMP and Crp by increasing the galactose uptake rate. Thus, E. coli actively limits its galactose catabolism at the expense of otherwise possible faster growth.
Visual Overview
SynopsisThe authors analyze the role transcription plays in regulating bacterial metabolic flux. Of 91 transcriptional regulators studied, 2/3 affect absolute fluxes, but only a small number of regulators control the partitioning of flux between different metabolic pathways.Focusing on central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli, we aim here to systematically identify transcriptional regulators that control the distribution of metabolic fluxes during aerobic growth on hexoses. To assess the condition dependence of transcriptional control of flux, we selected glucose and galactose as two substrates that are highly similar, yet lead to distinct growth rates (Soupene et al, 2003), overall metabolic rates (De Anda et al, 2006; Samir El et al, 2009) and levels of catabolite repression (Hogema et al, 1998; Bettenbrock et al, 2007).Experimentally determined fluxes (Fischer and Sauer, 2003a) during growth on glucose and galactose reveal two distinct metabolic states. On glucose, high metabolic rates lead to high overflow metabolism and respiratory fluxes through the TCA cycle. On galactose, in contrast, metabolism was much slower without overflow metabolism and respiratory fluxes exclusively through the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle (Fischer and Sauer, 2003b).To determine which transcriptional events controlled these two distinct metabolic states, we determined intracellular fluxes in 91 transcription factor mutants. These genetic perturbations primarily affected absolute fluxes but not the distribution of fluxes. The distribution of flux between glycolysis and pentose–phosphate pathway in upper metabolism, e.g., remained constant in all mutants under all conditions. Transcriptional control of the flux distribution was exclusively seen at the acetyl‐CoA branch point. On glucose, nine transcription factors controlled the distribution of fluxes at this branch point, five of which (ArcA, IHFA, IHFB, PdhR, Fur) did so presumably directly through their known targets in TCA cycle and/or respiration. Without known targets in the relevant pathways, the remaining four transcription factors (GlpR, QseB, HdfR, GlcC) may act either indirectly or directly through unknown targets. On galactose, transcriptional control focused exclusively on the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle. While deletion of six transcription factors (Cra, Crp, IHFA, IHFB, Mlc, NagC) abolished or reduced the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle flux, we demonstrate by substrate‐limited chemostat experiments, derepression of galactose uptake and show by metabolomics that five of these transcription factors act indirectly through increased cAMP concentrations that allosterically activate Crp, the only direct transcription factors that controls the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle (Nanchen et al, 2008).Overall, our absolute flux data demonstrate that control of flux splitting during growth on hexoses was confined to the acetyl‐CoA branch point in E. coli. Of the 36 transcription factors known to target genes in pathways that diverge from the acetyl‐CoA branch point, only one transcription factor on galactose and five plus potentially four others on glucose showed altered flux splitting. The primary focus of steady state transcriptional control on the acetyl‐CoA branch point, and thus the metabolic decision between the energetically efficient respiration and the less efficient but more rapid fermentation, was recently also demonstrated with only relative flux data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fendt et al, 2010).In contrast to glucose‐grown Bacillus subtilis (Fischer et al, 2005), for batch glucose‐grown E. coli, none of the investigated transcription factor mutants exhibited improved biomass productivity. However, the mutants Cra, IHF A, IHF B and NagC with increased uptake rates grew much faster at almost unaltered biomass yields. As the removal of the glucose PTS‐based repression with a Crr mutant also resulted in increased galactose uptake, we provide evidence that E. coli actively represses its galactose uptake at the expense of otherwise possible rapid growth.
In contrast to the canonical respiro‐fermentative glucose metabolism, fully respiratory galactose metabolism depends exclusively on the PEP‐glyoxylate cycle.Of 91 transcription factors, 2/3 affect absolute fluxes, but only one controls the distribution of fluxes on galactose and nine on glucose.Transcriptional control of hexose flux distributions is confined to the acetyl‐CoA branch point.The PEP‐glyoxylate cycle is controlled by cAMP‐Crp in a hexose uptake rate‐dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Glucose degradation pathways are central for energy and carbon metabolism throughout all domains of life. They provide ATP, NAD(P)H, and biosynthetic precursors for amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids. It is general knowledge that cyanobacteria and plants oxidize carbohydrates via glycolysis [the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway] and the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway. However, we found that both possess a third, previously overlooked pathway of glucose breakdown: the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. Its key enzyme, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate (KDPG) aldolase, is widespread in cyanobacteria, moss, fern, algae, and plants and is even more common among cyanobacteria than phosphofructokinase (PFK), the key enzyme of the EMP pathway. Active KDPG aldolases from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis and the plant barley (Hordeum vulgare) were biochemically characterized in vitro. KDPG, a metabolite unique to the ED pathway, was detected in both in vivo, indicating an active ED pathway. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that photosynthetic eukaryotes acquired KDPG aldolase from the cyanobacterial ancestors of plastids via endosymbiotic gene transfer. Several Synechocystis mutants in which key enzymes of all three glucose degradation pathways were knocked out indicate that the ED pathway is physiologically significant, especially under mixotrophic conditions (light and glucose) and under autotrophic conditions in a day/night cycle, which is probably the most common condition encountered in nature. The ED pathway has lower protein costs and ATP yields than the EMP pathway, in line with the observation that oxygenic photosynthesizers are nutrient-limited, rather than ATP-limited. Furthermore, the ED pathway does not generate futile cycles in organisms that fix CO2 via the Calvin–Benson cycle.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A major aim of biology is to predict phenotype from genotype. Here we ask if we can describe all possible molecular states (phenotypes) for a cell that fabricates itself at a constant rate, given its enzyme kinetics and the stoichiometry of all reactions (the genotype). For this, we must understand the autocatalytic process of cellular growth which is inherently nonlinear: steady-state self-fabrication requires a cell to synthesize all of its components, including metabolites, enzymes and ribosomes, in the proportions that exactly match its own composition -- the growth demand thus depends on the cellular composition. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these components should be tuned to accomplish this synthesis task -- the cellular composition thus depends on the growth demand. We here derive a theory that describes all phenotypes that solve this circular problem; the basic equations show how the concentrations of all cellular components and reaction rates must be balanced to get a constant self-fabrication rate. All phenotypes can be described as a combination of one or more minimal building blocks, which we call Elementary Growth Modes (EGMs). EGMs can be used as the theoretical basis for all models that explicitly model self-fabrication, such as the currently popular Metabolism and Expression models. We then used our theory to make concrete biological predictions: we find that natural selection for maximal growth rate drives microorganisms to states of minimal phenotypic complexity: only one EGM will be active when cellular growth rate is maximised. The phenotype of a cell is only extended with one more EGM whenever growth becomes limited by an additional biophysical constraint, such as a limited solvent capacity of a cellular compartment. Our theory starts from basic biochemical and evolutionary considerations, and describes unicellular life, both in growth-promoting and in stress-inducing environments, in terms of EGMs, the universal building blocks of self-fabrication and a cell9s phenotype.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The technology for building functionally complete or ‘whole-cell’ biological simulations is rapidly developing. However, the predictive capabilities of these simulations are hindered by the availability of parameter values, which are often difficult or even impossible to obtain experimentally and must therefore be estimated. Using E. coli’s glycolytic network as a model system, we describe and apply a new method which can estimate the values of all the system’s 102 parameters – fit to observations from studies of proteomics, metabolomics, enzyme kinetics and chemical energetics – and find that the resulting metabolic models are not only well-fit, but also dynamically stable. An analysis of how well parameter values in the network were determined by the training data revealed that over 80\% of the parameter values were not well-specified. Moreover, the distribution of well-determined values was biased to a specific part of the network and against certain types of experimental data. Our results also suggest that perturbing the functional, energetic space of parameters (rather than traditional metabolic parameters) is a superior strategy for exploring the space of biological dynamics. The estimated parameter values matched both training data and previously withheld validation data within an order of magnitude for over 85\% of the data points; notably, the area of greatest frustration in the network was also the most fully determined. Finally, our estimation method showed that fidelity to physiological observations such as network response time is enforced at the cost of fit to molecular parameter values. In summary, our reformulation enables estimation of accurate, biologically relevant parameters, generates insight into the biology of the simulated network, and appears generalizable to any biochemical network – potentially including whole-cell models.},

	abstract = {Kinetic models provide the means to understand and predict the dynamic behaviour of enzymes upon different perturbations. Despite their obvious advantages, classical parameterizations require large amounts of data to fit their parameters. Particularly, enzymes displaying complex reaction and regulatory (allosteric) mechanisms require a great number of parameters and are therefore often represented by approximate formulae, thereby facilitating the fitting but ignoring many real kinetic behaviours. Here, we show that full exploration of the plausible kinetic space for any enzyme can be achieved using sampling strategies provided a thermodynamically feasible parameterization is used. To this end, we developed a General Reaction Assembly and Sampling Platform (GRASP) capable of consistently parameterizing and sampling accurate kinetic models using minimal reference data. The former integrates the generalized MWC model and the elementary reaction formalism. By formulating the appropriate thermodynamic constraints, our framework enables parameterization of any oligomeric enzyme kinetics without sacrificing complexity or using simplifying assumptions. This thermodynamically safe parameterization relies on the definition of a reference state upon which feasible parameter sets can be efficiently sampled. Uniform sampling of the kinetics space enabled dissecting enzyme catalysis and revealing the impact of thermodynamics on reaction kinetics. Our analysis distinguished three reaction elasticity regions for common biochemical reactions: a steep linear region (0{\textgreater} ΔGr {\textgreater}-2 kJ/mol), a transition region (-2{\textgreater} ΔGr {\textgreater}-20 kJ/mol) and a constant elasticity region (ΔGr {\textless}-20 kJ/mol). We also applied this framework to model more complex kinetic behaviours such as the monomeric cooperativity of the mammalian glucokinase and the ultrasensitive response of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of Escherichia coli. In both cases, our approach described appropriately not only the kinetic behaviour of these enzymes, but it also provided insights about the particular features underpinning the observed kinetics. Overall, this framework will enable systematic parameterization and sampling of enzymatic reactions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since the introduction of metabolic models and flux balance analysis (FBA) in systems biology, several attempts have been made to supplement these formulations with expression information to form metabolic and expression models (ME-models). However, directly accounting for enzyme and mRNA production in the mathematical programming formulation of the problem is challenging because of the dilution of the macromolecules, which introduces a bilinear term in the mass-balance equations, making the problem non-linear and harder to solve than linear formulations like FBA. Furthermore, no attempts have been made at including thermodynamic constraints in these formulations, which would yield an even more complex mixed-integer non-linear problem. We propose here a new framework, called Expression and Thermodynamics Flux (ETFL), as a new ME-model implementation. ETFL is a top-down model formulation, from metabolism to RNA synthesis, that simulates thermodynamic-compliant intracellular fluxes as well as enzyme and mRNA concentration levels. The formulation results in a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) that enables both relative and absolute metabolite, protein, and mRNA concentration integration. The proposed formulation is compatible with mainstream MILP solvers and does not require a non-linear solver. It also leverages the MILP formulation to account for growth-dependent parameters, such as relative protein or mRNA content. We present here the formulation of ETFL along with its validation using results obtained from a well-characterized E. coli model. We show that ETFL is able to reproduce proteome-limited growth, which FBA cannot. We also subject it to different analyses, including the prediction of feasible mRNA and enzyme concentrations in the cell, and propose ETFL-based adaptations of other common FBA-based procedures.

Strategies for coupling production to growth, however, are often not trivial to find. Here we present OptCouple, a constraint-based modeling algorithm to simultaneously identify combinations of gene knockouts, insertions and medium supplements that lead to growth-coupled production of a target compound. We validated the algorithm by showing that it can find novel strategies that are growth-coupled in silico for a compound that has not been coupled to growth previously, as well as reproduce known growth-coupled strain designs for two different target compounds. Furthermore, we used OptCouple to construct an alternative design with potential for higher production.

	abstract = {It should be possible to predict the rate of growth of Escherichia coli of a given genotype in a specified environment. The idea that the rate of synthesis of ATP determines the rate of growth and that the yield of ATP determines the yield of growth is entrenched in bacterial physiology, yet this idea is inconsistent with experimental results. In minimal media the growth rate and yield vary with the carbon source in a manner independent of the rate of formation and yield of ATP. With acetate as the carbon source, anapleurotic reactions, not ATP synthesis, limit the growth rate. For acetate and other gluconeogenic substrates the limiting step appears to be the formation of triose phosphate. I conclude that the rate of growth is controlled by the rate of formation of a precursor metabolite and, thus, of monomers such as amino acids derived from it. The protein-synthesizing system is regulated according to demand for protein synthesis. I examine the conjecture that the signal for this regulation is the ratio of uncharged tRNA to aminoacyl-tRNA, that this signal controls the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate, and that the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate controls transcription of rrn genes. Differential equations describing this system were solved numerically for steady states of growth; the computed values of ribosomes and guanosine tetraphosphate and the maximal growth rate agree with experimental values obtained from the literature of the past 35 years. These equations were also solved for dynamical states corresponding to nutritional shifts up and down.},

A data‐driven, integrative modeling methodology is presented that unifies signal transduction, gene expression, and metabolic processes under a common framework. Training on an aggregated dataset results in improved prediction of regulatory connections and measured phenotypes.

A curated Escherichia coli dataset combining gene expression data for genetic and environmental perturbations, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction metabolic pathways, and growth data is constructed.Gene expression, signal transduction, and metabolic datasets are incorporated into a novel integrative framework for genome‐scaling modeling.Training of the genome‐scale model with the integrated dataset leads to high correlation between predicted and measured phenotypes and reveals new regulatory links.A model enrichment technique identifies under‐represented and highly variable knockouts to drive experimentation.},

To assess its potential effect, here we develop a flux balance model of Escherichia coli cell metabolism that takes into account a systems-level constraint for the concentration of enzymes catalyzing the various metabolic reactions in the crowded cytoplasm. We demonstrate that the model's predictions for the relative maximum growth rate of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells in single substrate-limited media, and the sequence and mode of substrate uptake and utilization from a complex medium are in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations. These results suggest that molecular crowding represents a bound on the achievable functional states of a metabolic network, and they indicate that models incorporating this constraint can systematically identify alterations in cellular metabolism activated in response to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Identifying the factors that determine microbial growth rate under various environmental and genetic conditions is a major challenge of systems biology. While current genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches enable us to successfully predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes, including maximal biomass yield, the prediction of actual growth rate is a long standing goal. This gap stems from strictly relying on data regarding reaction stoichiometry and directionality, without accounting for enzyme kinetic considerations. Here we present a novel metabolic network-based approach, MetabOlic Modeling with ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT), which predicts metabolic flux rate and growth rate by utilizing prior data on enzyme turnover rates and enzyme molecular weights, without requiring measurements of nutrient uptake rates. The method is based on an identified design principle of metabolism in which enzymes catalyzing high flux reactions across different media tend to be more efficient in terms of having higher turnover numbers. Extending upon previous attempts to utilize kinetic data in genome-scale metabolic modeling, our approach takes into account the requirement for specific enzyme concentrations for catalyzing predicted metabolic flux rates, considering isozymes, protein complexes, and multi-functional enzymes. MOMENT is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of various metabolic phenotypes in E. coli, including intracellular flux rates and changes in gene expression levels under different growth rates. Most importantly, MOMENT is shown to predict growth rates of E. coli under a diverse set of media that are correlated with experimental measurements, markedly improving upon existing state-of-the art stoichiometric modeling approaches. These results support the view that a physiological bound on cellular enzyme concentrations is a key factor that determines microbial growth rate.},

In this work, we directly map transcriptional profiles to growth rates by gathering published gene-expression data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with corresponding growth-rate measurements. Using a machine-learning technique called k-nearest-neighbors regression, we build a model which predicts growth rate from gene expression. By exploiting the correlated nature of gene expression and sparsifying the model, we capture 81\% of the variance in growth rate of the E. coli dataset, while reducing the number of features from {\textgreater}4,000 to 9. In S. cerevisiae, we account for 89\% of the variance in growth rate, while reducing from {\textgreater}5,500 dimensions to 18.

	abstract = {Constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. Therefore the solutions to this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. By uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction’s flux in the network can be obtained. However, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. Therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optGpSampler), which implements the Artificial Centering Hit-and-Run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the COBRA Toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpSampler. Results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optGpSampler is up to 40 times faster than gpSampler. Application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network reconstructions indicate that optGpSampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpSampler towards similar sampling distributions. For networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optGpSampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms.

Interestingly, flotillin microdomains are of similar size in eukaryotic cells. The soluble domains of FloA form higher order oligomers of up to several hundred kDa in vitro, showing that like eukaryotic flotillins, bacterial assemblies are based in part on their ability to self-oligomerize. However, B. subtilis paralogs show significantly different diffusion rates, and consequently do not colocalize into a common microdomain. Dual colour time lapse experiments of flotillins together with other detergent-resistant proteins in bacteria show that proteins colocalize for no longer than a few hundred milliseconds, and do not move together. Our data reveal that the bacterial membrane contains defined-sized protein domains rather than functional microdomains dependent on flotillins. Based on their distinct dynamics, FloA and FloT confer spatially distinguishable activities, but do not serve as molecular scaffolds.},

	abstract = {l-Serine biosynthesis, a crucial metabolic process in most domains of life, is initiated by d-3-phosphoglycerate (d-3-PG) dehydrogenation, a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction catalyzed by d-3-PG dehydrogenase (SerA). d-2-Hydroxyglutarate (d-2-HG) is traditionally viewed as an abnormal metabolite associated with cancer and neurometabolic disorders. Here, we reveal that bacterial anabolism and catabolism of d-2-HG are involved in l-serine biosynthesis in Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. SerA catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) to d-2-HG, responsible for the major production of d-2-HG in vivo. SerA combines the energetically favorable reaction of d-2-HG production to overcome the thermodynamic barrier of d-3-PG dehydrogenation. We identified a bacterial d-2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH), a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent enzyme, that converts d-2-HG back to 2-KG. Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFQO) are also essential in d-2-HG metabolism through their capacity to transfer electrons from D2HGDH. Furthermore, while the mutant with D2HGDH deletion displayed decreased growth, the defect was rescued by adding l-serine, suggesting that the D2HGDH is functionally tied to l-serine synthesis. Substantial flux flows through d-2-HG, being produced by SerA and removed by D2HGDH, ETF, and ETFQO, maintaining d-2-HG homeostasis. Overall, our results uncover that d-2-HG–mediated coupling between SerA and D2HGDH drives bacterial l-serine synthesis.},

From these observed constants and the acid dissociation and metal binding constants of the substrates, an ionic equilibrium constant (K) has been calculated for each reaction. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentrations, for the reaction of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, Kobs = [Σ phosphohydroxypyruvate][Σ NADH][Σ D-3-phosphoglycerate][Σ NAD+], K = [phosphohydroxypyruvate3−][NADH](H+)[D-3-phosphoglycerate3−][NAD+]; and for the reaction of l-phosphoserine aminotransferase, Kobs = [Σ α-ketoglutarate][Σ L-phosphoserine][Σ phosphohydroxypyruvate][Σ L-glutamate], K = [α-ketoglutarate2−][L-H · phosphoserine2−][phosphohydroxypyruvate3−][L-H · glutamate−] The values of K for the reaction of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase are 3.45 ± 0.04 × 10−13m (38 °C) [ΔG ° = +74.2 kJ/mol (+17.7 kcal/mol)] and 1.30 ± 0.01 × 10−13m (25 °C) [ΔG ° = +73.5 kJ/mol (+17.6 kcal/mol)]. Kobs at 38 °C, pH 7.0, and [K+] = 0.2 m is 2.92 × 10−6 ([Mg2+] = 0) and 2.89 × 10−6 ([Mg2+] = 1 mm). The value of K for the reaction of l-phosphoserine aminotransferase is 133 ± 1 [ΔG0 = −12.5 kJ/mol (−3.0 kcal/mol)] a value insignificantly affected by temperature (4–43 °C). Kobs at pH 7.0 (38 °C, [K+] = 0.2 m) is 85.9 ([Mg2+] = 0), 84.6 ([Mg2+] = 1 mm) and 80.7 ([Mg2+] = 10 mm). For these calculations the acid dissociation and potassium and magnesium binding constants of d-3-phosphoglycerate, phosphohydroxypyruvate, and l-phosphoserine were determined under physiological conditions by titration. The values of the equilibrium constants reported in this work are highly significantly different from direct determinations reported by others. The implications of the results to the understanding of the biosynthesis of l-serine are discussed.},

Here, we present a new approach to enrich RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs): Orthogonal Organic Phase Separation (OOPS), which is compatible with downstream proteomics and RNA sequencing. OOPS enables recovery of RBPs and free protein, or protein-bound RNA and free RNA, from a single sample in an unbiased manner. By applying OOPS to human cell lines, we extract the majority of known RBPs, and importantly identify additional novel RBPs, including those from previously under-represented cellular compartments. The high yield and unbiased nature of OOPS facilitates its application in both dynamic and inaccessible systems. Thus, we have identified changes in RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells following nocodazole cell-cycle arrest, and defined the first bacterial RNA-interactome. Overall, OOPS provides an easy-to-use and flexible technique that opens new opportunities to characterize RNA-protein interactions and explore their dynamic behaviour.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mechanisms that maintain pluripotency, or that cause its destabilization to initiate development, are complex and incompletely understood. We have developed a model to predict stabilized PSC gene regulatory network (GRN) states in response to input signals. Our strategy used random asynchronous Boolean simulations (R‐ABS) to simulate single‐cell fate transitions and strongly connected components (SCCs) strategy to represent population heterogeneity. This framework was applied to a reverse‐engineered and curated core GRN for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and used to simulate cellular responses to combinations of five signaling pathways. Our simulations predicted experimentally verified cell population compositions and input signal combinations controlling specific cell fate transitions. Extending the model to PSC differentiation, we predicted a combination of signaling activators and inhibitors that efficiently and robustly generated a Cdx2+Oct4− cells from naïve mESCs. Overall, this platform provides new strategies to simulate cell fate transitions and the heterogeneity that typically occurs during development and differentiation.

This study reports a computational framework that simulates gene regulatory network (GRN) specified cell fate transitions, and cell compositions, from uniform input signals to successfully predict cellular decision processes from signal‐perturbed mouse pluripotent stem cells.

A novel Boolean simulation framework is developed for predicting signal‐controlled GRN logic and stem cell fate decisions.Novel quantitative metrics facilitate the comparison of GRN properties in the context of different cell states.Micro‐environmental signals and feedback are incorporated into a GRN simulation framework.Applying this novel framework to an inferred mouse pluripotent stem cell GRN model accurately predicts experimentally observed cell fate outcomes upon exposure to complex exogenous signals.},

	abstract = {Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, integrating these data sources to generate predictions of steady-state metabolism typically requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the available data, which can be particularly computationally intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty. However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic modeling due to the complex kinetic rate laws typically employed and the resulting dynamic system that must be solved. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and variational inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of kinetic model parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of different problem scales, including large-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and developing new, efficient strain designs.},

We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems.

	abstract = {At genome scale, it is not yet possible to devise detailed kinetic models for metabolism because data on the in vivo biochemistry are too sparse. Predictive large-scale models for metabolism most commonly use the constraint-based framework, in which network structures constrain possible metabolic phenotypes at steady state. However, these models commonly leave many possibilities open, making them less predictive than desired. With increasingly available –omics data, it is appealing to increase the predictive power of constraint-based models (CBMs) through data integration. Many corresponding methods have been developed, but data integration is still a challenge and existing methods perform less well than expected. Here, we review main approaches for the integration of different types of –omics data into CBMs focussing on the methods’ assumptions and limitations. We argue that key assumptions – often derived from single-enzyme kinetics – do not generally apply in the context of networks, thereby explaining current limitations. Emerging methods bridging CBMs and biochemical kinetics may allow for –omics data integration in a common framework to provide more accurate predictions.},

	abstract = {Rational metabolic engineering methods are increasingly employed in designing the commercially viable processes for the production of chemicals relevant to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and food and beverage industries. With the growing availability of omics data and of methodologies capable to integrate the available data into models, mathematical modeling and computational analysis are becoming important in designing recombinant cellular organisms and optimizing cell performance with respect to desired criteria. In this contribution, we used the computational framework ORACLE (Optimization and Risk Analysis of Complex Living Entities) to analyze the physiology of recombinant Escherichia coli producing 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and to identify potential strategies for improved production of BDO. The framework allowed us to integrate data across multiple levels and to construct a population of large-scale kinetic models despite the lack of available information about kinetic properties of every enzyme in the metabolic pathways. We analyzed these models and we found that the enzymes that primarily control the fluxes leading to BDO production are part of central glycolysis, the lower branch of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the novel BDO production route. Interestingly, among the enzymes between the glucose uptake and the BDO pathway, the enzymes belonging to the lower branch of TCA cycle have been identified as the most important for improving BDO production and yield. We also quantified the effects of changes of the target enzymes on other intracellular states like energy charge, cofactor levels, redox state, cellular growth, and byproduct formation. Independent earlier experiments on this strain confirmed that the computationally obtained conclusions are consistent with the experimentally tested designs, and the findings of the present studies can provide guidance for future work on strain improvement. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of ORACLE for the accelerated design of microbial cell factories.},

In this study, with a goal of forecasting acute coronary syndrome (ACS), breast cancer, and colon cancer, we jointly analyzed LC–MS, NMR measurements of plasma samples, and the metadata corresponding to the lifestyle of participants. We used supervised data fusion based on multiple kernel learning and exploited the linearity of the models to identify significant metabolites/features for the separation of healthy referents and the cases developing a disease. We demonstrated that (i) fusing LC–MS, NMR, and metadata provided better separation of ACS cases and referents compared with individual data sets, (ii) NMR data performed the best in terms of forecasting breast cancer, while fusion degraded the performance, and (iii) neither the individual data sets nor their fusion performed well for colon cancer. Furthermore, we showed the strengths and limitations of the fusion models by discussing their performance in terms of capturing known biomarkers for smoking and coffee. While fusion may improve performance in terms of separating certain conditions by jointly analyzing metabolomics and metadata sets, it is not necessarily always the best approach as in the case of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, integrating these data sources to generate predictions of steady-state metabolism typically requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the available data, which can be particularly computationally intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty. However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic modeling due to the complex kinetic rate laws typically employed and the resulting dynamic system that must be solved. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and variational inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of kinetic model parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of different problem scales, including large-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and developing new, efficient strain designs.},

The model was able to reproduce experimental threshold curves for perturbations of the respiratory chain complexes, the F1F0-ATP synthase, the ADP/ATP carrier, the phosphate/OH carrier, and the proton leak. Thus, the model is well suited to study complex interactions within the OXPHOS system, especially with respect to physiological adaptations or pathological modifications, influencing substrate and product affinities or maximal catalytic rates. Moreover, it could be a useful tool to study the role of OXPHOS and its capacity to compensate or enhance physiopathologies of the mitochondrial and cellular energy metabolism.},

These qualitative network models aim to summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge and to provide a starting point for qualitative or quantitative modeling. The network reconstruction process is highly developed for metabolic mass transfer networks, and a number of genome-scale metabolic models are available. The picture looks very different for signal transduction networks: Despite years of dedicated work by the scientific community, we still do not have any comprehensive network models of these information transfer networks. In this chapter, we discuss the reasons for this lag in development. We focus on the specific challenges with information transfer networks in the light of genome-scale mechanistic models, and evaluate the different strategies the scientific community has developed to address these challenges. We conclude that the methods that have been so successful for modeling small signaling modules or metabolic networks are ill-suited to describe the empirical knowledge we have about information transfer due to the resolution difference they introduce. This resolution difference is relatively subtle in small networks, but becomes dramatic in genome-scale models. Hence, to be able to build mechanistic genome-scale models of signal transduction, it is imperative that we use reconstruction approaches that are adapted to this empirical knowledge.},

This workflow incorporates complementary approaches across scientific disciplines; provides molecular insight into how PTMs influence cellular fitness during nutrient shifts; and demonstrates how mechanistic details of PTMs can be explored at different biological scales. As a proof of concept, we present a global analysis of PTMs on enzymes in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Based on our workflow results, we conduct a more detailed, mechanistic analysis of the PTMs in three proteins: enolase, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and transaldolase. Application of this workflow identified the roles of specific PTMs in observed experimental phenomena and demonstrated how individual PTMs regulate enzymes, pathways, and, ultimately, cell phenotypes.},

However, our understanding of how these models work, especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers, has lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable images, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source and work on a pre-trained convnet with minimal setup.},

Using a multiomics approach in mammalian cells treated with four types of mitochondrial stressors, we identify activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as the main regulator of the stress response. Surprisingly, canonical mitochondrial unfolded protein response genes mediated by ATF5 are not activated. Instead, ATF4 activates the expression of cytoprotective genes, which reprogram cellular metabolism through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). Mitochondrial stress promotes a local proteostatic response by reducing mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, inhibiting mitochondrial translation, and coupling the activation of the ISR with the attenuation of mitochondrial function. Through a trans–expression quantitative trait locus analysis, we provide genetic evidence supporting a role for Fh1 in the control of Atf4 expression in mammals. Using gene expression data from mice and humans with mitochondrial diseases, we show that the ATF4 pathway is activated in vivo upon mitochondrial stress. Our data illustrate the value of a multiomics approach to characterize complex cellular networks and provide a versatile resource to identify new regulators of mitochondrial-related diseases.},

A given protein abundance can be obtained from infinitely many combinations of these rates. This raises the question of whether the natural rates for each gene result from historical accidents, or are there rules that give certain combinations a selective advantage? We address this question using high-throughput measurements in rapidly growing cells from diverse organisms to find that about half of the rate combinations do not exist: genes that combine high transcription with low translation are strongly depleted. This depletion is due to a trade-off between precision and economy: high transcription decreases stochastic fluctuations but increases transcription costs. Our theory quantitatively explains which rate combinations are missing, and predicts the curvature of the fitness function for each gene. It may guide the design of gene circuits with desired expression levels and noise.},

The goal of this pilot study was to test the usefulness of unbiased metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches to delineate biological pathways associated with COPD phenotypes and outcomes. Blood was collected from 149 current or former smokers with or without COPD and separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma. PBMCs and plasma were analyzed using microarray and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Statistically significant transcripts and compounds were mapped to pathways using IMPaLA. Results showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism was associated with worse airflow obstruction and more COPD exacerbations. Sphingolipid metabolism was associated with worse lung function outcomes and exacerbation severity requiring hospitalizations. The strongest associations between a pathway and a certain COPD outcome were: fat digestion and absorption and T cell receptor signaling with lung function outcomes; antigen processing with exacerbation frequency; arginine and proline metabolism with exacerbation severity; and oxidative phosphorylation with emphysema. Overlaying transcriptomic and metabolomics datasets across pathways enabled outcome and phenotypic differences to be determined. Findings are relevant for identifying molecular targets for animal intervention studies and early intervention markers in human cohorts.},

	abstract = {Microbes affect each other’s growth in multiple, often elusive, ways. The ensuing interdependencies form complex networks, believed to reflect taxonomic composition as well as community-level functional properties and dynamics. The elucidation of these networks is often pursued by measuring pairwise interactions in coculture experiments. However, the combinatorial complexity precludes an exhaustive experimental analysis of pairwise interactions, even for moderately sized microbial communities. Here, we used a machine learning random forest approach to address this challenge. In particular, we show how partial knowledge of a microbial interaction network, combined with trait-level representations of individual microbial species, can provide accurate inference of missing edges in the network and putative mechanisms underlying the interactions. We applied our algorithm to three case studies: an experimentally mapped network of interactions between auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains, a community of soil microbes, and a large in silico network of metabolic interdependencies between 100 human gut-associated bacteria. For this last case, 5\% of the network was sufficient to predict the remaining 95\% with 80\% accuracy, and the mechanistic hypotheses produced by the algorithm accurately reflected known metabolic exchanges. Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, may drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.
IMPORTANCE Different organisms in a microbial community may drastically affect each other’s growth phenotypes, significantly affecting the community dynamics, with important implications for human and environmental health. Novel culturing methods and the decreasing costs of sequencing will gradually enable high-throughput measurements of pairwise interactions in systematic coculturing studies. However, a thorough characterization of all interactions that occur within a microbial community is greatly limited both by the combinatorial complexity of possible assortments and by the limited biological insight that interaction measurements typically provide without laborious specific follow-ups. Here, we show how a simple and flexible formal representation of microbial pairs can be used for the classification of interactions via machine learning. The approach we propose predicts with high accuracy the outcome of yet-to-be performed experiments and generates testable hypotheses about the mechanisms of specific interactions.},

In particular, we observe that current methods chiefly perform machine learning on sequence and domain information to produce large sets of candidate interactions that are further assessed and pruned to generate final, highly probable sets. Structure-based studies have also emphasized the electrostatic properties and evolutionary transformations of pathogenic interfaces, supplying crucial insight into antigenic determinants and the ways pathogens compete for host protein binding. Advancements in spectroscopic and crystallographic methods complement the aforementioned techniques, permitting the rigorous study of true positives at a molecular level.

The experimental assessment of in vivo intracellular fluxes using stable isotopic tracers is essential if we are to understand metabolic function and regulation. Flux estimation based on 13C or 2H labeling relies on complex simulation and iterative fitting; processes that necessitate a level of expertise that ordinarily preclude the non-expert user. To overcome this, we have developed SUMOFLUX, a methodology that is broadly applicable to the targeted analysis of 13C-metabolic fluxes. By combining surrogate modeling and machine learning, we trained a predictor to specialize in estimating flux ratios from measurable 13C-data. SUMOFLUX targets specific flux features individually, which makes it fast, user-friendly, applicable to experimental design and robust in terms of experimental noise and exchange flux magnitude. Collectively, we predict that SUMOFLUX's properties realistically pave the way to high-throughput flux analyses.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples.

SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the centers of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches.

Our multi-omics data together with bioassays comprehensively reveal the impact of bismuth on a diverse array of intracellular pathways, in particular, disruption of central carbon metabolism is systematically evaluated as a primary bismuth-targeting system in H. pylori. Through temporal dynamics profiling, we demonstrate that bismuth initially perturbs the TCA cycle and then urease activity, followed by the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of energy production, and in the meantime, induces extensive down-regulation in H. pylori metabolome. The present study thus expands our knowledge on the inhibitory actions of bismuth and provides a novel systematic perspective of H. pylori in response to a clinical drug that sheds light on enhanced therapeutic methodologies.},

For this, the Aa, was applied to cross the monolayer of epithelial keratinocytes (OBA-9) to reach the fibroblasts layer (HGF-1) in the basal chamber. The Monolaurin treatments (25 or 50 μM) were added immediately after the inoculation of the dual-chamber with Aa. After 24 h, the transcriptional factors and metabolites produced were quantified in the remaining cell layers (insert and basal chamber) and in supernatant released from the cells. The genes IL-1α, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF analyzed in HGF-1 concentrations showed a decreased expression when treated with both concentration of Monolaurin. In keratinocytes, the genes IL-6, IL-18, and TNF presented a higher expression and the expression of IL-1α decreased when treated with the two cited concentrations. The production of glycerol and pyruvic acid increased, and the 2-deoxytetronic acid NIST, 4-aminobutyric acid, pinitol and glyceric acid, presented lower concentrations because of the treatment with 25 and/or 50 μM of Monolaurin. Use of monolaurin modulated the immune response and metabolite production when administered for 24 h in a dual-chamber model inoculated with A. actinomycetemcomitans. In summary, this study indicates that monolaurin had antimicrobial activity and modulated the host immune response and metabolite production when administered for 24 h in a dual-chamber model inoculated with A. actinomycetemcomitans.},

To gain insight into how this model hyperthermophile copes with heat stress, we compared transcriptomic and metabolomic data of cells subjected to a temperature shift from 90 °C to 97 °C. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing to characterize the global variation in gene expression levels, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and targeted ion exchange liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) were used to determine changes in metabolite levels. Of the 552 differentially expressed genes in response to heat shock conditions, 257 were upregulated and 295 were downregulated. In particular, there was a significant downregulation of genes for synthesis and transport of amino acids. At the metabolite level, 37 compounds were quantified. The level of di-myo-inositol phosphate, a canonical heat stress solute among marine hyperthermophiles, increased considerably (5.4-fold) at elevated temperature. Also, the levels of mannosylglycerate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDPGlcNac) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine were enhanced. The increase in the pool of UDPGlcNac was concurrent with an increase in the transcript levels of the respective biosynthetic genes. This work provides the first metabolomic analysis of the heat shock response of a hyperthermophile.},

A major challenge in computational          biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes          based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate          probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide          a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions          from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. (1998).},

Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)4,5 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets12—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

Yang et al. (2) recently showed that the functions of proteins produced from splice variants from a given gene—different proteoforms—can be as different as those for proteins encoded by entirely different genes. Li et al. (3) showed that splice variants play a central role in modulating complex traits. However, the standard paradigm of proteomic analysis, the “bottom-up” strategy pioneered by Eng and Yates some 20 years ago (4), does not directly identify proteoforms. We argue that proteomic analysis needs to provide the identities and abundances of the proteoforms themselves, rather than just their peptide surrogates. Developing new proteome-wide strategies to accomplish this goal presents a formidable but not insurmountable technological challenge that will benefit the biomedical community.

As recently suggested, enzyme levels are often much higher than absolutely needed to maintain metabolic flux. However, given the potential burden of high enzyme levels it seems likely that cells control enzyme expression to meet other cellular objectives. In this review, we discuss whether crosstalk between metabolism and transcription could inform cells about how much enzyme is optimal for various fitness aspects. Two major problems should be addressed in order to understand optimization of enzyme levels by crosstalk. First, mapping of metabolite–protein interactions will be crucial to obtain a better mechanistic understanding of crosstalk. Second, investigating cellular objectives that define optimal enzyme levels can reveal the functional relevance of crosstalk. We present recent studies that approach these problems, drawing from experimental transcript and metabolite data, and from theoretical network analyses.

	abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)–based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for “fast” reactions and incorporates “slow” reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporating kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.},

In this paper, we describe the integration of large-scale metabolic and signaling networks with a regulatory gene network. We focus on the response to infection in mouse macrophage cells. Our computational framework allows to virtually simulate any type of infection and to follow its effect on the cell. The model comprises 3,507 chemical species involved in 4,630 reactions evolving at the fast time scale of metabolic and signaling processes. These interact with 20 genes evolving at the slow time scale of gene expression and regulation. We develop a simulator for this model and use it to study infections with Porphyromonas gingivalis.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Systems biology models are typically simulated using a single formalism such as ordinary differential equations (ODE) or stochastic methods. However, more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different biological concepts are better described using different methods, e.g., stationary metabolism is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA and ODE frameworks results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is how to describe such hybrid models coupling multiple frameworks in a standardized way, so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently and in a reproducible manner. Results: This paper presents a scheme and implementation for encoding dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby allowing to exchange multi-framework computational models between software tools. The paper shows the feasibility of the approach using various example models and demonstrates that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results. As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and sbmlutils.

There exist similarities and differences in metabolism and physiology between normal proliferative cells and tumor cells. Once a cell enters the cell cycle, metabolic machinery is engaged to facilitate various processes. The kinetics and regulation of these metabolic changes have not been properly evaluated. To correlate the orchestration of these processes with the cell cycle, we analyzed the transition from quiescence to proliferation of a non-malignant murine pro-B lymphocyte cell line in response to IL-3. Using multiplex mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we show that the transition to proliferation shares features generally attributed to cancer cells: upregulation of glycolysis, lipid metabolism, amino-acid synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and the urea cycle. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling of this transition reveals similarities to cancer-related metabolic pathways. In particular, we find that methionine is consumed at a higher rate than that of other essential amino acids, with a potential link to maintenance of the epigenome.},

	abstract = {In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy to address these challenges by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary reaction steps and incorporating all phenotypic observations, upon perturbation, in its model parameterization scheme. Here, we present a kinetic model of Escherichia coli core metabolism that satisfies the fluxomic data for wild-type and seven mutant strains by making use of the EM concepts. This model encompasses 138 reactions, 93 metabolites and 60 substrate-level regulatory interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions and a number of reactions in other parts of the metabolism. Parameterization is performed using a formal optimization approach that minimizes the discrepancies between model predictions and flux measurements. The predicted fluxes by the model are within the uncertainty range of experimental flux data for 78\% of the reactions (with measured fluxes) for both the wild-type and seven mutant strains. The remaining flux predictions are mostly within three standard deviations of reported ranges. Converting the EM-based parameters into a Michaelis–Menten equivalent formalism revealed that 35\% of Km and 77\% of kcat parameters are within uncertainty range of the literature-reported values. The predicted metabolite concentrations by the model are also within uncertainty ranges of metabolomic data for 68\% of the metabolites. A leave-one-out cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be predicted more accurately. The constructed model and the parameterization procedure presented in this study pave the way for the construction of larger-scale kinetic models with more narrowly distributed parameter values as new metabolomic/fluxomic data sets are becoming available for E. coli and other organisms.},

Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.},

Some of the kinetic constants needed for a model could be collected from ever-growing literature and public web resources, but they are often incomplete, incompatible, or simply not available. We address this lack of information by parameter balancing, a method to complete given sets of kinetic constants. Based on Bayesian parameter estimation, it exploits the thermodynamic dependencies among different biochemical quantities to guess realistic model parameters from available kinetic data. Our algorithm accounts for varying measurement conditions in the input data (pH value and temperature). It can process kinetic constants and state-dependent quantities such as metabolite concentrations or chemical potentials, and uses prior distributions and data augmentation to keep the estimated quantities within plausible ranges.

However, an estimation of enzyme parameters has been a bottleneck in the computer simulation of metabolic dynamics. In this study, the ensemble-modeling approach was integrated with the transomics data to construct kinetic models. Kinetic metabolic models of a photosynthetic bacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, were constructed to identify engineering targets for improving ethanol production based on an understanding of metabolic regulatory systems. A kinetic model ensemble was constructed by randomly sampling parameters, and the best 100 models were selected by comparing predicted metabolic state with a measured dataset, including metabolic flux, metabolite concentrations, and protein abundance data. Metabolic control analysis using the model ensemble revealed that a large pool size of 3-phosphoglycerate could be a metabolic buffer responsible for the stability of the Calvin–Benson cycle, and also identified that phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a promising engineering target to improve a pyruvate supply such as for ethanol production. Overexpression of PGK in the metabolically engineered PCC 6803 strain showed that the specific ethanol production rate and ethanol titers at 48 h were 1.23- and 1.37-fold greater than that of the control strain. PGK is useful for future metabolic engineering since pyruvate is a common precursor for the biosynthesis of various chemicals.},

Nonequilibrium ATP concentrations are the typical free energy source, with one cycle of a molecular machine consuming a certain number of ATP, providing a fixed free energy budget. Since evolution is expected to favor rapid-turnover machines that operate efficiently, we investigate how this free energy budget can be allocated to maximize flux. Unconstrained optimization eliminates intermediate metastable states, indicating that flux is enhanced in molecular machines with fewer states. When maintaining a set number of states, we show that—in contrast to previous findings—the flux-maximizing allocation of dissipation is not even. This result is consistent with the coexistence of both “irreversible” and reversible transitions in molecular machine models that successfully describe experimental data, which suggests that, in evolved machines, different transitions differ significantly in their dissipation.},

To understand the effect of amino acids, E. coli B and K were grown at a steady state of 0.35 h−1 in glucose minimal medium with and without amino acids, while their metabolism, protein abundance and gene expression were compared. The results showed that amino acids promoted higher acetate excretion, higher fatty acid biosynthesis (K strain), repressed glucose uptake rate, and decreased expression of proteins associated with the TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt and amino acid biosynthesis. In presence of amino acids, E. coli K upregulated fatty acid biosynthesis and repressed more genes and proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis than E. coli B. These findings are correlated with higher yield on glucose (Yx/s) and high specific biomass production rate (qx) in K strain in the presence of amino acids. In contrast, pre-formed precursor molecules such as amino acids did not affect fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli B or Yx/s and qx, which were higher than those of E. coli K, suggesting that constitutive synthesis of energetically demanding precursors and higher fatty acid β-oxidation activity is key for high biomass-performer E. coli B. Both strains turned off unnecessary pathways and directed their metabolism to proteome efficient overflow metabolism likely to generate energy and provide protein to functions supporting higher growth rate.},

	abstract = {One approach to experimental science involves creating hypotheses, then testing them by varying one or more independent variables and assessing the effects of this variation on the processes of interest. We use this strategy to compare the intellectual status and available evidence for two models or views of mechanisms of transmembrane drug transport into intact biological cells. One (BDII) asserts that lipoidal phospholipid Bilayer Diffusion Is Important, while a second (PBIN) proposes that in normal intact cells Phospholipid Bilayer diffusion Is Negligible (i.e. may be neglected quantitatively), because evolution selected against it, and with transmembrane drug transport being effected by genetically encoded proteinaceous carriers or pores, whose ‘natural’ biological roles and substrates are based in intermediary metabolism. Despite a recent review elsewhere, we can find no evidence able to support BDII as we can find no experiments in intact cells in which phospholipid bilayer diffusion was either varied independently or measured directly (although there are many papers where it was inferred by seeing a covariation of other dependent variables). By contrast, we find an abundance of evidence showing cases in which changes in the activities of named and genetically identified transporters led to measurable changes in the rate or extent of drug uptake. PBIN also has considerable predictive power, and accounts readily for the large differences in drug uptake between tissues, cells and species, in accounting for the metabolite-likeness of marketed drugs, in pharmacogenomics, and in providing a straightforward explanation for the late-stage appearance of toxicity and of lack of efficacy during drug discovery programmes despite macroscopically adequate pharmacokinetics. Consequently, the view that Phospholipid Bilayer diffusion Is Negligible (PBIN) provides a starting hypothesis for assessing cellular drug uptake that is much better supported by the available evidence,},

	abstract = {Background
Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) are the key components of signal transduction, cell-cell adhesion and energy and material transport into and out from the cells. For the deep understanding of these processes, structure determination of transmembrane proteins is indispensable. However, due to technical difficulties, only a few transmembrane protein structures have been determined experimentally. Large-scale genomic sequencing provides increasing amounts of sequence information on the proteins and whole proteomes of living organisms resulting in the challenge of bioinformatics; how the structural information should be gained from a sequence.

Results
Here, we present a novel method, TMFoldRec, for fold prediction of membrane segments in transmembrane proteins. TMFoldRec based on statistical potentials was tested on a benchmark set containing 124 TMP chains from the PDBTM database. Using a 10-fold jackknife method, the native folds were correctly identified in 77 \% of the cases. This accuracy overcomes the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a key feature of TMFoldRec algorithm is the ability to estimate the reliability of the prediction and to decide with an accuracy of 70 \%, whether the obtained, lowest energy structure is the native one.

Conclusion
These results imply that the membrane embedded parts of TMPs dictate the TM structures rather than the soluble parts. Moreover, predictions with reliability scores make in this way our algorithm applicable for proteome-wide analyses.

	abstract = {Microcalorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) have been used to conduct a thermodynamic investigation of reactions catalyzed by 3-dehydroquinate synthase and by 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase. These are the second and third reactions in the metabolic pathway leading to the formation of chorismate. The two reactions are: \{DAHP(aq)=3-dehydroquinate(aq)+phosphate(aq)\} and \{3-dehydroquinate(aq)=3-dehydroshikimate(aq)+H2O(l)\}. The h.p.l.c. measurements showed that the first reaction proceeded to completion and that the value of the apparent equilibrium constant for the second reaction was K′=(4.6±1.5) (Hepes buffer, temperature T=298.15K, pH=7.50, and ionic strength Im=0.065mol·kg−1). Calorimetric measurements led to a molar enthalpy of reaction ΔrHm(cal)=−(50.9±1.1)kJ·mol−1 (Hepes buffer, T=298.15K, pH=7.46, Im=0.070mol·kg−1) for the first reaction and to ΔrHm(cal)=(2.3±2.3)kJ·mol−1 (Hepes buffer, T=298.15K, pH=7.42, Im=0.069mol·kg−1) for the second reaction. These results were analyzed in terms of a chemical equilibrium model that accounts for the multiplicity of ionic states of the reactants and products. These calculations gave thermodynamic quantities at T=298.15K and Im=0 for chemical reference reactions involving specific ionic forms. For the reaction DAHP3−(aq)=3-dehydroquinate−(aq)+HPO42−(aq), the standard molar enthalpy of reaction ΔrH°m=−(51.1±4.5)kJ·mol−1. For the reaction 3-dehydroquinate(aq)=3-dehydroshikimate(aq) +H2O(l), the equilibrium constant K=(4.6±1.5) and ΔrH°m=(2.3±2.3)kJ·mol−1. A Benson type approach was used to estimate the standard molar entropy change ΔrS°m for the first reference reaction and led to the value K≈2·1014 for this reaction. Values of the apparent equilibrium constants and the standard transformed Gibbs free energy changes ΔrG°m under approximately physiological conditions are given for the biochemical reactions.},

	abstract = {Some anaerobic archaea and bacteria live on substrates that do not allow the synthesis of one mol of ATP per mol of substrate via substrate level phosphorylation. Energy conservation in these cases is only possible by a chemiosmotic mechanism that involves the generation of an electrochemical ion gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane that then drives ATP synthesis via an ATP synthase. The minimal amount of energy required for ATP synthesis is thus dependent on the magnitude of the electrochemical ion gradient, the phosphorylation potential in the cell and the ion/ATP ratio of the ATP synthase. It was always thought that the minimum biological energy quantum is defined as the amount of energy required to translocate one ion across the cytoplasmic membrane. We will discuss the thermodynamics of the reactions involved in chemiosmosis and describe the limitations for ion transport and ATP synthesis that led to the proposal that at least -20 kJ/mol are required for ATP synthesis. We will challenge this hypothesis by arguing that the enzyme energizing the membrane may translocate net less than one ion: By using a primary pump connected to an antiporter module a stoichiometry below one can be obtained, implying that the minimum biological energy quantum that sustains life is even lower than assumed to date.},

Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.

In recent years, tandem mass spectrometry has emerged as a new analytical technique that can provide additional information for high-resolution quantification of metabolic fluxes in complex biological systems. In this methods paper, we present recent advances in algorithms for incorporating tandem MS measurements into existing 13C-MFA approaches that are based on the elementary metabolite units (EMU). Specifically, EMU-based algorithms are presented for simulating tandem MS data in biochemical network models and for correcting tandem MS data for natural isotope abundances.},

Under in vitro conditions, flux regulation followed enzyme concentrations and kinetics. In E. coli, only one of the isozymes of phosphofructokinase (PfkA) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FbaA) facilitate Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) flux, but under in vitro assays, these isozymes were interchangeable. Additionally, in vitro introduction of the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway improved glycolysis rates, while in vivo overexpression of the ED pathway could not capture significant flux unless its phosphotransferase system (PTS) was knocked out. Lastly, in vivo dynamic 13 C-experiments revealed that the labeling order of EMP pathway intermediates was not strictly cascade, indicating intracellular metabolites were not well mixed. These enigmatic observations cannot be fully explained by thermodynamics or substrate level regulations.

	abstract = {Overflow metabolism in the form of aerobic acetate excretion by Escherichia coli is an important physiological characteristic of this common industrial microorganism. Although acetate formation occurs under conditions of high glucose consumption, the genetic mechanisms that trigger this phenomenon are not clearly understood. We report on the role of the NADH/NAD ratio (redox ratio) in overflow metabolism. We modulated the redox ratio in E. coli through the expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae (water-forming) NADH oxidase. Using steady-state chemostat cultures, we demonstrated a strong correlation between acetate formation and this redox ratio. We furthermore completed genome-wide transcription analyses of a control E. coli strain and an E. coli strain overexpressing NADH oxidase. The transcription results showed that in the control strain, several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration were repressed as the glucose consumption rate increased. Moreover, the relative repression of these genes was alleviated by expression of NADH oxidase and the resulting reduced redox ratio. Analysis of a promoter binding site upstream of the genes which correlated with redox ratio revealed a degenerate sequence with strong homology with the binding site for ArcA. Deletion of arcA resulted in acetate reduction and increased the biomass yield due to the increased capacities of the TCA cycle and respiration. Acetate formation was completely eliminated by reducing the redox ratio through expression of NADH oxidase in the arcA mutant, even at a very high glucose consumption rate. The results provide a basis for studying new regulatory mechanisms prevalent at reduced NADH/NAD ratios, as well as for designing more efficient bioprocesses.},

Pleiotropic regulatory mutations affect diverse cellular processes, posing a challenge to our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships across multiple biological scales. Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) allows for such mutations to be found and characterized in the context of clear selection pressures. Here, several ALE-selected single-mutation variants in RNA polymerase (RNAP) of Escherichia coli are detailed using an integrated multi-scale experimental and computational approach. While these mutations increase cellular growth rates in steady environments, they reduce tolerance to stress and environmental fluctuations. We detail structural changes in the RNAP that rewire the transcriptional machinery to rebalance proteome and energy allocation toward growth and away from several hedging and stress functions. We find that while these mutations occur in diverse locations in the RNAP, they share a common adaptive mechanism. In turn, these findings highlight the resource allocation trade-offs organisms face and suggest how the structure of the regulatory network enhances evolvability.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Thermodynamic analysis of biological reaction networks requires the availability of accurate and consistent values of Gibbs free energies of reaction and formation. These Gibbs energies can be measured directly via the careful design of experiments or can be computed from the curated Gibbs free energy databases. However, the computed Gibbs free energies of reactions and formations do not satisfy the thermodynamic constraints due to the compounding effect of measurement errors in the experimental data. The propagation of these errors can lead to a false prediction of pathway feasibility and uncertainty in the estimation of thermodynamic parameters. Results: This work proposes a data reconciliation framework for thermodynamically consistent estimation of Gibbs free energies of reaction, formation and group contributions from experimental data. In this framework, we formulate constrained optimization problems that reduce measurement errors and their effects on the estimation of Gibbs energies such that the thermodynamic constraints are satisfied. When a subset of Gibbs free energies of formations is unavailable, it is shown that the accuracy of their resulting estimates is better than that of existing empirical prediction methods. Moreover, we also show that the estimation of group contributions can be improved using this approach. Further, we provide guidelines based on this approach for performing systematic experiments to estimate unknown Gibbs formation energies.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing availability of transcriptomic and metabolomic data can be used to deeply analyze and make ever-expanding predictions about biological processes, as changes in the reaction fluxes through genome-wide pathways can now be tracked. Currently, constraint-based metabolic modeling approaches, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), can quantify metabolic fluxes and make steady-state flux predictions on a genome-wide scale using optimization principles. However, relating the differential gene expression or differential metabolite abundances in different physiological states to the differential flux profiles remains a challenge. Here we present a novel method, named REMI (Relative Expression and Metabolomic Integrations), that employs genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to translate differential gene expression and metabolite abundance data obtained through genetic or environmental perturbations into differential fluxes to analyze the altered physiology for any given pair of conditions. REMI is the first method that integrates thermodynamics together with relative gene-expression and metabolomic data as constraints for FBA. We applied REMI to integrate into the Escherichia coli GEM publicly available sets of expression and metabolomic data obtained from two independent studies and under wide-ranging conditions. The differential flux distributions obtained from REMI corresponding to the various perturbations better agreed with the measured fluxomic data, and thus better reflected the different physiological states, than a traditional model. Compared to the similar alternative method that provides one solution from the solution space, REMI was also able to enumerate several alternative flux profiles using a mixed-integer linear programming approach. Using this important advantage, we performed a high-frequency analysis of common genes and their associated reactions in the obtained alternative solutions and identified the most commonly regulated genes across any two given conditions. We illustrate that this new implementation provides more robust and biologically relevant results for a better understanding of the system physiology.},

Concepts for the calculation of the change in Gibbs energy of biochemical reactions have long been established. However, a concept for incorporation of cross-membrane transport in these calculations is still missing, although the theory for calculating thermodynamic properties of transport processes is long known. Here, we have developed two equivalent equations to calculate the change in Gibbs energy of combined transport and reaction processes based on two different ways of treating biochemical thermodynamics. We illustrate the need for these equations by showing that in some cases there is a significant difference between the proposed correct calculation and using an approximative method. With the developed equations, thermodynamic analysis of metabolic networks spanning over multiple physical compartments can now be correctly described.},

The specific growth rate vs bacterial mass of single cultures consuming small amounts of glucose was followed. The data were analyzed with the computer programs described previously. For neither batch nor chemostat-cultured organisms did growth follow the monod growth law. Rather, the growth rate vs residual glucose concentration has an almost abrupt change in slope, indicative of a passive diffusion barrier prior to an uptake system possessing hyperbolic dependency. Calculations showed that the diffusion through the outer membrane via the porin channels could quantitatively account for the deviations from hyperbolic dependency. Long term chemostat culture alters the bacteria so that the maximum specific growth rate is reduced, but the initial dependence on glucose concentration is increased approaching more closely the theoretical limit. Therefore there was both a change in the outer membrane channels and the uptake activity of the cytoplasmic membrane.},

The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant.

Examination of the changes in the values of the apparent kinetic parameters KSapp, kcatapp, and (kcat/KM)app in response to various modes of inhibition may be informative to students when presented in combination with Gibbs energy profiles.

Enhanced Rubisco catalysis is expected to increase crop yields, but a substantially improved enzyme has evaded bioengineers for decades. Based on correlations between Rubisco's kinetic parameters, it is widely posited that tradeoffs stemming from the catalytic mechanism strictly constrain Rubisco's maximum catalytic potential. Though compelling, the reasoning that established that view was based on data from only {\textasciitilde}20 organisms. Here we re-examine these tradeoffs with an expanded dataset including data from {\textgreater}200 organisms. We find that most correlations are substantially attenuated, with the inverse relationship between carboxylation k\_cat and specificity S\_C/O being a key example. However, the correlation predicted by one tradeoff model is stronger and more significant in our expanded dataset. In this model, increased catalytic efficiency (k\_cat/K\_M) for carboxylation requires a similar increase in catalytic efficiency for the competing oxygenation reaction, evidenced here by a strong power-law correlation between those catalytic efficiencies. In contrast to previous work, our results imply that Rubisco evolution is constrained mostly by the physicochemical limits of O2/CO2 recognition, which should reframe efforts to understand and engineer this very central enzyme.},

	abstract = {Stoichiometric models of metabolism, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), are classically applied to predicting steady state rates - or fluxes - of metabolic reactions in genome-scale metabolic networks. Here we revisit the central assumption of FBA, i.e. that intracellular metabolites are at steady state, and show that deviations from flux balance (i.e. flux imbalances) are informative of some features of in vivo metabolite concentrations. Mathematically, the sensitivity of FBA to these flux imbalances is captured by a native feature of linear optimization, the dual problem, and its corresponding variables, known as shadow prices. First, using recently published data on chemostat growth of Saccharomyces cerevisae under different nutrient limitations, we show that shadow prices anticorrelate with experimentally measured degrees of growth limitation of intracellular metabolites. We next hypothesize that metabolites which are limiting for growth (and thus have very negative shadow price) cannot vary dramatically in an uncontrolled way, and must respond rapidly to perturbations. Using a collection of published datasets monitoring the time-dependent metabolomic response of Escherichia coli to carbon and nitrogen perturbations, we test this hypothesis and find that metabolites with negative shadow price indeed show lower temporal variation following a perturbation than metabolites with zero shadow price. Finally, we illustrate the broader applicability of flux imbalance analysis to other constraint-based methods. In particular, we explore the biological significance of shadow prices in a constraint-based method for integrating gene expression data with a stoichiometric model. In this case, shadow prices point to metabolites that should rise or drop in concentration in order to increase consistency between flux predictions and gene expression data. In general, these results suggest that the sensitivity of metabolic optima to violations of the steady state constraints carries biologically significant information on the processes that control intracellular metabolites in the cell.},

The latter requires adequate thermodynamic driving force in metabolic reactions so that forward flux substantially exceeds reverse flux. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method, metabolic tug-of-war (mTOW), which computes steady-state metabolite concentrations in microorganisms on a genome-scale. mTOW is shown to explain up to 55\% of the observed variation in measured metabolite concentrations in E. coli and C. acetobutylicum across various growth media. Our approach, based strictly on first thermodynamic principles, is the first method that successfully predicts high-throughput metabolite concentration data in bacteria across conditions.},

	abstract = {A persistent obstacle for constructing kinetic models of metabolism is uncertainty in the kinetic properties of enzymes. Currently, available methods for building kinetic models can cope indirectly with uncertainties by integrating data from different biological levels and origins into models. In this study, we use the recently proposed computational approach iSCHRUNK (in Silico Approach to Characterization and Reduction of Uncertainty in the Kinetic Models), which combines Monte Carlo parameter sampling methods and machine learning techniques, in the context of Bayesian inference. Monte Carlo parameter sampling methods allow us to exploit synergies between different data sources and generate a population of kinetic models that are consistent with the available data and physicochemical laws. The machine learning allows us to data-mine the a priori generated kinetic parameters together with the integrated datasets and derive posterior distributions of kinetic parameters consistent with the observed physiology. In this work, we used iSCHRUNK to address a design question: can we identify which are the kinetic parameters and what are their values that give rise to a desired metabolic behavior? Such information is important for a wide variety of studies ranging from biotechnology to medicine. We used the proposed methodology to find parameters that ensure a rate improvement of the xylose uptake (XTR) in a glucose-xylose co-utilizing S. cerevisiae strain. Our results indicate that only three kinetic parameters need to be accurately characterized to describe the studied physiology, and ultimately to design and control the desired responses of the metabolism. This framework paves the way for a new generation of methods that will systematically integrate the wealth of available omics data and efficiently extract the information necessary for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology decisions.},

	abstract = {Many computational models for analyzing and predicting cell physiology rely on in vitro data, collected in dilute and cleanly controlled buffer solutions. However, this can mislead models because about 40\% of the intracellular volume is occupied by a dense mixture of proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, RNA, and DNA. These intracellular macromolecules interact with enzymes and their reactants and affect the kinetics of biochemical reactions, making in vivo reactions considerably more complex than the in vitro data indicates. In this work, we present a new type of kinetics that captures and quantifies the effect of volume exclusion and any other spatial phenomena on the kinetics of elementary reactions. We further developed a framework that allows for the efficient parameterization of this type of kinetics using particle simulations. Our formulation, entitled GEneralized Elementary Kinetics (GEEK), can be used to analyze and predict the effect of intracellular crowding on enzymatic reactions and was herein applied to investigate the influence of crowding on phosphoglycerate mutase in Escherichia coli, which exhibits prototypical reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Current research indicates that many enzymes are reaction limited and not diffusion limited, and our results suggest that the influence of fractal diffusion is minimal for these reaction-limited enzymes. Instead, increased association rates and decreased dissociation rates lead to a strong decrease in the effective maximal velocities 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the effective Michaelis-Menten constants 𝐾𝑀 under physiologically relevant volume occupancies. Finally, the effects of crowding in the context of a linear pathway were explored, with the finding that crowding can have a redistributing effect, relative to ideal conditions, on the effective flux responses in the case of two-fold enzyme overexpression. We suggest that the presented framework in combination with detailed kinetics models will improve our understanding of enzyme reaction networks under non-ideal conditions.},

For the 234 orphan reactions from KEGG 2011 that became non-orphan in KEGG 2018, BridgIT predicted the exact or a highly related enzyme for 211 of them. Moreover, for 334 out of 379 novel reactions in 2014 that were later catalogued in KEGG 2018, BridgIT predicted the exact or highly similar enzyme sequences.

	abstract = {Large-scale kinetic models are used for designing, predicting, and understanding the metabolic responses of living cells. Kinetic models are particularly attractive for the biosynthesis of target molecules in cells as they are typically better than other types of models at capturing the complex cellular biochemistry. Using simpler stoichiometric models as scaffolds, kinetic models are built around a steady-state flux profile and a metabolite concentration vector that are typically determined via optimization. However, as the underlying optimization problem is underdetermined, even after incorporating available experimental omics data, one cannot uniquely determine the operational configuration in terms of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations. As a result, some reactions can operate in either the forward or reverse direction while still agreeing with the observed physiology. Here, we analyze how the underlying uncertainty in intracellular fluxes and concentrations affects predictions of constructed kinetic models and their design in metabolic engineering and systems biology studies. To this end, we integrated the omics data of optimally grown Escherichia coli into a stoichiometric model and constructed populations of non-linear large-scale kinetic models of alternative steady-state solutions consistent with the physiology of the E. coli aerobic metabolism. We performed metabolic control analysis (MCA) on these models, highlighting that MCA-based metabolic engineering decisions are strongly affected by the selected steady state and appear to be more sensitive to concentration values rather than flux values. To incorporate this into future studies, we propose a workflow for moving towards more reliable and robust predictions that are consistent with all alternative steady-state solutions. This workflow can be applied to all kinetic models to improve the consistency and accuracy of their predictions. Additionally, we show that, irrespective of the alternative steady-state solution, increased activity of phosphofructokinase and decreased ATP maintenance requirements would improve cellular growth of optimally grown E. coli.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of cancer is important for the development of appropriate cancer therapies. The task is challenging because tumors evolve as heterogeneous cell populations with an unknown number of genetically distinct subclones of varying frequencies. Conventional approaches based on bulk sequencing are limited in addressing this challenge as clones cannot be observed directly. Single-cell sequencing holds the promise of resolving the heterogeneity of tumors; however, it has its own challenges including elevated error rates, allelic dropout, and uneven coverage. Here, we develop a new approach to mutation detection in individual tumor cells by leveraging the evolutionary relationship among cells. Our method, called SCIΦ, jointly calls mutations in individual cells and estimates the tumor phylogeny among these cells. Employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme we robustly account for the various sources of noise in single-cell sequencing data. Our approach enables us to reliably call mutations in each single cell even in experiments with high dropout rates and missing data. We show that SCIΦ outperforms existing methods on simulated data and applied it to different real-world datasets, namely a whole exome breast cancer as well as a panel acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset.

We first collected and curated aqueous thermodynamic data, including reaction-equilibrium constants, enthalpies of reaction, Gibbs free energies of formation, enthalpies of formation, entropy changes of formation of compounds, and proton- and metal-ion-binding constants. Next, we formulated the calculation of equilibrium constants as a function of temperature and calculated the standard entropy change of formation (ΔfS∘) using a model based on molecular properties. The median absolute error in estimating ΔfS∘ was 0.013 kJ/K/mol. We also estimated magnesium binding constants for 618 compounds using a linear regression model validated against measured data. We demonstrate the improved performance of the current method (8.17 kJ/mol in median absolute residual) over the current state-of-the-art method (11.47 kJ/mol) in estimating the 185 new reactions added in this work. The efforts here fill in gaps for thermodynamic calculations under various conditions, specifically different temperatures and metal-ion concentrations. These, to our knowledge, new capabilities empower the study of thermodynamic driving forces underlying the metabolic function of organisms living under diverse conditions.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been studied intensely for {\textgreater}25 y. Yet, even for the Escherichia coli TRN—probably the best characterized TRN—several questions remain. Here, we address three questions: (i) How complete is our knowledge of the E. coli TRN; (ii) how well can we predict gene expression using this TRN; and (iii) how robust is our understanding of the TRN? First, we reconstructed a high-confidence TRN (hiTRN) consisting of 147 transcription factors (TFs) regulating 1,538 transcription units (TUs) encoding 1,764 genes. The 3,797 high-confidence regulatory interactions were collected from published, validated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data and RegulonDB. For 21 different TF knockouts, up to 63\% of the differentially expressed genes in the hiTRN were traced to the knocked-out TF through regulatory cascades. Second, we trained supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the expression of 1,364 TUs given TF activities using 441 samples. The algorithms accurately predicted condition-specific expression for 86\% (1,174 of 1,364) of the TUs, while 193 TUs (14\%) were predicted better than random TRNs. Third, we identified 10 regulatory modules whose definitions were robust against changes to the TRN or expression compendium. Using surrogate variable analysis, we also identified three unmodeled factors that systematically influenced gene expression. Our computational workflow comprehensively characterizes the predictive capabilities and systems-level functions of an organism’s TRN from disparate data types.},

	abstract = {In natural environments, microbes are typically non‐dividing and gauge when nutrients permit division. Current models are phenomenological and specific to nutrient‐rich, exponentially growing cells, thus cannot predict the first division under limiting nutrient availability. To assess this regime, we supplied starving Escherichia coli with glucose pulses at increasing frequencies. Real‐time metabolomics and microfluidic single‐cell microscopy revealed unexpected, rapid protein, and nucleic acid synthesis already from minuscule glucose pulses in non‐dividing cells. Additionally, the lag time to first division shortened as pulsing frequency increased. We pinpointed division timing and dependence on nutrient frequency to the changing abundance of the division protein FtsZ. A dynamic, mechanistic model quantitatively relates lag time to FtsZ synthesis from nutrient pulses and FtsZ protease‐dependent degradation. Lag time changed in model‐congruent manners, when we experimentally modulated the synthesis or degradation of FtsZ. Thus, limiting abundance of FtsZ can quantitatively predict timing of the first cell division.

It has been hypothesized in previous reports that the glyoxylate shunt is active in E. coli BL21, the low acetate producer, and inactive in E. coli JM109, the high acetate producer. This hypothesis was further strengthened by incorporating 13C from uniformly labeled glucose into TCA cycle intermediates. Using northern blot analyses, the current report demonstrates that the reason for the inactivity of the glyoxylate pathway in E. coli JM109 is the no apparent transcription of isocitrate lyase (aceA) and malate synthase (aceB), and transcription of the isocitrate lyase repressor (iclR). The reverse is seen in E. coli BL21 where the glyoxylate pathway is active due to constitutive transcription of aceA and aceB and no transcription of the iclR. In addition, there is a difference between the two strains in the transcription of the acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs), phosphotransacetylase–acetate kinase (pta–ackA) pathway, and pyruvate oxidase (poxB), pathway. The transcript of acs is higher in E. coli BL21 and lower in the E. coli JM109, while the reverse is true for poxB transcription.},

The pgi gene, whose product catalyzes the second step in glycolysis, was deleted in a growth-optimized Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 strain. The initial knockout (KO) strain exhibited an 80\% drop in growth rate that was largely recovered in eight replicate, but phenotypically distinct, cultures after undergoing adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Multi-omic data sets showed that the loss of pgi substantially shifted pathway usage, leading to a redox and sugar phosphate stress response. These stress responses were overcome by unique combinations of innovative mutations selected for by ALE. Thus, the coordinated mechanisms from genome to metabolome that lead to multiple optimal phenotypes after the loss of a major gene product were revealed.

These fluidizing lipids tightly controlled respiratory metabolism, an effect that can be explained with a quantitative model of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) that features diffusion-coupled reactions between enzymes and electron carriers (quinones).

	abstract = {New experimental results on bacterial growth inspire a novel top-down approach to study cell metabolism, combining mass balance and proteomic constraints to extend and complement Flux Balance Analysis. We introduce here Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic costs associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a single additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally observed pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of growth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently and propose an “ensemble averaging” procedure to account for unknown protein costs. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as the growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory, growth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative states with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA allows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion and growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth laws., The intracellular protein levels of exponentially growing bacteria are known to vary strongly with growth conditions, as described by quantitative “growth laws”. This work introduces a computational genome-scale framework (Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA) which incorporates growth laws into canonical Flux Balance Analysis. Upon introducing 3 parameters based on established growth laws for E. coli, CAFBA accurately reproduces empirical results on the growth-rate dependent rate of carbon overflow and growth yield, and generates testable predictions about cellular energetic strategies and protein expression levels. CAFBA therefore provides a simple, quantitative approach to balancing the trade-off between growth and its associated biosynthetic costs at genome-scale, without the burden of tuning many inaccessible parameters.},

We use the framework of a general model of fractal-like distribution networks together with data on energy transformation in mammals to analyze and predict allometric scaling of aerobic metabolism over a remarkable 27 orders of magnitude in mass encompassing four levels of organization: individual organisms, single cells, intact mitochondria, and enzyme molecules. We show that, whereas rates of cellular metabolism in vivo scale as M−1/4, rates for cells in culture converge to a single predicted value for all mammals regardless of size. Furthermore, a single three-quarter power allometric scaling law characterizes the basal metabolic rates of isolated mammalian cells, mitochondria, and molecules of the respiratory complex; this overlaps with and is indistinguishable from the scaling relationship for unicellular organisms. This observation suggests that aerobic energy transformation at all levels of biological organization is limited by the transport of materials through hierarchical fractal-like networks with the properties specified by the model. We show how the mass of the smallest mammal can be calculated (≈1 g), and the observed numbers and densities of mitochondria and respiratory complexes in mammalian cells can be understood. Extending theoretical and empirical analyses of scaling to suborganismal levels potentially has important implications for cellular structure and function as well as for the metabolic basis of aging.},

	abstract = {The technology for building functionally complete or ‘whole-cell’ biological simulations is rapidly developing. However, the predictive capabilities of these simulations are hindered by the availability of parameter values, which are often difficult or even impossible to obtain experimentally and must therefore be estimated. Using E. coli’s glycolytic network as a model system, we describe and apply a new method which can estimate the values of all the system’s 102 parameters – fit to observations from studies of proteomics, metabolomics, enzyme kinetics and chemical energetics – and find that the resulting metabolic models are not only well-fit, but also dynamically stable. An analysis of how well parameter values in the network were determined by the training data revealed that over 80\% of the parameter values were not well-specified. Moreover, the distribution of well-determined values was biased to a specific part of the network and against certain types of experimental data. Our results also suggest that perturbing the functional, energetic space of parameters (rather than traditional metabolic parameters) is a superior strategy for exploring the space of biological dynamics. The estimated parameter values matched both training data and previously withheld validation data within an order of magnitude for over 85\% of the data points; notably, the area of greatest frustration in the network was also the most fully determined. Finally, our estimation method showed that fidelity to physiological observations such as network response time is enforced at the cost of fit to molecular parameter values. In summary, our reformulation enables estimation of accurate, biologically relevant parameters, generates insight into the biology of the simulated network, and appears generalizable to any biochemical network – potentially including whole-cell models.},

Visual Overview
SynopsisGenome sequencing and annotation, along with biochemical characterization of cellular machinery, has enabled reconstruction of cellular processes on the genomic scale since the turn of the millennium. Initial targets for reconstruction were primarily microorganisms, but with advancements in genomic sequencing technology and annotation techniques, reconstructions of higher‐order species are appearing (Reed et al, 2006a). Of the available genome‐scale reconstructions, those for metabolism are most prevalent due to the large body of work characterizing and cataloging metabolic processes. Similarly, the metabolic reconstruction of the bacterium E. coli is arguably the most advanced because it possesses the most complete body of data available for its metabolism and growth behavior. Building on the rich history of E. coli metabolic reconstruction (Figure 1), we generated an updated genome‐scale metabolic reconstruction for E. coli containing 1260 ORFs from the latest genome annotation (Riley et al, 2006). We characterize the iAF1260 reconstruction, detail its conversion to a computational model and demonstrate its application as a model to predict selected cellular phenotypes.Figure 1 characterizes the content of iAF1260 by categorizing the ORFs (i.e., genes), reactions and metabolites contained in the reconstruction in terms of their Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) functional class. The figure also outlines the genetic content of five previous reconstructions of E. coli metabolism. The major areas of expansion for iAF1260 relative to previous work (i.e., the enhancements) fall into five categories: (i) an increased scope, (ii) compartmentalization of the reconstruction into three distinct cellular compartments (the cytosol, periplasm and extra‐cellular space), (iii) increased pathway detail, (iv) incorporation of reaction thermodynamic information, and (v) alignment with the E. coli specific database, EcoCyc. Each of these five major areas of expansion is discussed further in the text.In an effort to clearly demonstrate how a genome‐scale reconstruction can be utilized as a computational model for phenotypic predictions (e.g., flux balance analysis (FBA) calculations), we delineated the steps necessary for converting a reconstruction to a computational model (2, Figure 3). In summary, this process involves: (i) explicit assignment of the metabolites participating in a reaction (often times incorporated into the reconstruction process), (ii) definition of a system boundary, (iii) conversion of the defined system into a mathematical format that forms the basis for a computational model, (iv) curation of the network, which often requires filling gaps in the reconstruction, and (v) determining the strain specific parameters for a particular organism or system (e.g., maintenance parameters).After formulating a computational model based on the iAF1260 reconstruction, we utilized this model to predict and quantify the active pathways and probable system outputs under glucose aerobic conditions, a common E. coli laboratory growth condition. In this process, we addressed modeling issues specific to E. coli and the chosen growth conditions that are required for accurate phenotypic predictions using iAF1260, which include (i) transcriptional regulatory events, (ii) cellular maintenance costs, and (iii) reaction kinetic effects. We then used the information from this process and applied it to study growth under a different condition, aerobic growth on succinate. The modeling predictions made using iAF1260 agreed well with reported experimental values under these conditions (Figure 3). Looking further at modeling predictions on a pathway by pathway and reaction by reaction basis, we compared results from growth on glucose to 13C‐labeled experiments (Fischer et al, 2004) and found a good agreement between predicted and observed values. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine how changes in key model parameters affect the computational results generated using FBA in conjunction with the iAF1260 model.In forming iAF1260, we incorporated thermodynamic information to provide another means of assessing reaction reversibility beyond what is stated in the primary literature and assignments made using general heuristic rules. This process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, utilized flux variability analysis (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003) under 174 different carbon source conditions to identify reactions that operated in a thermodynamically infeasible direction during near optimal growth. Specific examples are presented that describe how thermodynamically inconsistent reactions were altered for inclusion in iAF1260. Additionally, this analysis facilitated the further classification of reactions as essential, substitutable or blocked. Interestingly, a large number of the reactions in the reconstruction behaved uniformly regardless of the carbon source being utilized. Once reactions that operated in thermodynamically infeasible directions according to the flux variability analysis were identified and adjusted to remove all thermodynamic inconsistencies, we examined calculated ΔrG’ values and further adjusted reactions to be consistent with those we predicted to be irreversible with high likelihood.To demonstrate how iAF1260 can be used as context for biological content, we analyzed two high‐throughput data types: growth phenotype (http://www.biolog.com) and gene essentiality (Figure 5) (Baba et al, 2006; Joyce et al, 2006) data for E. coli. To do this, we utilized FBA to screen carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources that could support simulated growth, and also computationally determined the essential ORFs for growth under glucose aerobic conditions. We compared our predictions to the high‐throughput data sets and outlined the level or agreement between computational and experimental results. Whereas the agreements validate the content of the reconstruction and modeling methods (an overall agreement of 76\% for growth phenotype and 92\% for gene essentiality predictions), the disagreements provide area for further investigation (included in the Supplementary Data). For the growth phenotypes, disagreements indicate possible areas where there are either errors in the reconstruction, where regulation limits the utilization of pathways needed for growth, and/or point to areas where further biochemical characterization is needed (targeted areas for biological discovery). Disagreements in gene essentiality data point to specific areas where additional intracellular and transport reactions can be examined to rectify the disagreements or identify a current limitation of the reconstruction and modeling methods (e.g., transcription and translation processes are not currently incorporated in the modeling scheme).Finally, future directions for improvement of the metabolic reconstruction of E. coli are discussed, and as the field of systems biology expands, it is expected that iAF1260 will serve as a key component for the study of E. coli and related organisms by providing a comprehensive picture of cellular metabolism.
We generated a genome‐scale reconstruction of the model organism E. coli K‐12 MG1655 which includes 1260 ORFs from the latest genome annotation and thermodynamic information for reactions and compounds included in the reconstruction. In the reconstruction process, we synchronized the contents of this reconstruction with the EcoCyc/MetaCyc databases to include the most up to date information available for E. coli metabolism.We characterized the reconstruction content with respect to previous reconstructions of E. coli metabolism and detail five major enhancements over the previous version: increased scope, compartmentalization, increased pathway detail, incorporation of reaction thermodynamics and alignment with the EcoCyc database.We delineated the steps necessary to utilize a reconstruction as a predictive model for constraint‐based analyses and verified that the included content was able to predict observable outcomes when compared to growth experiments.To determine and quantify the computational model's ability to predict cellular phenotypes, we examined the influence of specific parameters on flux balancing solutions and compared computational predictions with available high‐throughput experimental data. Modeling predictions agreed well with both high‐throughput growth and gene‐essentiality data and disagreements provide specific areas for biological discovery and model refinement/expansion.},

The effect of a knockout of these reactions on the production of biomass and the production of individual biomass precursors was analyzed. Changes in the distribution of fluxes in the cell after knockout of these unfavorable reactions were also studied.

Cyanobacteria must balance separate demands for energy generation, carbon assimilation, and biomass synthesis. We used shotgun proteomics to investigate proteome allocation strategies in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as it adapted to light and inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation. When partitioning the proteome into seven functional sectors, we find that sector sizes change linearly with growth rate. The sector encompassing ribosomes is significantly smaller than in E. coli, which may explain the lower maximum growth rate in Synechocystis. Limitation of light dramatically affects multiple proteome sectors, whereas the effect of Ci limitation is weak. Carbon assimilation proteins respond more strongly to changes in light intensity than to Ci. A coarse-grained cell economy model generally explains proteome trends. However, deviations from model predictions suggest that the large proteome sectors for carbon and light assimilation are not optimally utilized under some growth conditions and may constrain the proteome space available to ribosomes.},

In this review, we describe the path from the choice of target molecule to scaling production up to commercial volumes. We present and explain some of the current challenges and gaps in our knowledge that must be overcome in order to bring our bioengineering capabilities to the level of other engineering disciplines. Challenges start at molecule selection, where a difficult balance between economic potential and biological feasibility must be struck. Pathway design and construction have recently been revolutionized by next-generation sequencing and exponentially improving DNA synthesis capabilities. Although pathway optimization can be significantly aided by enzyme expression characterization through proteomics, choosing optimal relative protein expression levels for maximum production is still the subject of heuristic, non-systematic approaches. Toxic metabolic intermediates and proteins can significantly affect production, and dynamic pathway regulation emerges as a powerful but yet immature tool to prevent it. Host engineering arises as a much needed complement to pathway engineering for high bioproduct yields; and systems biology approaches such as stoichiometric modeling or growth coupling strategies are required. A final, and often underestimated, challenge is the successful scale up of processes to commercial volumes. Sustained efforts in improving reproducibility and predictability are needed for further development of bioengineering.},

A collection of 2632 unfiltered knockout designs in Escherichia coli was evaluated by the workflow. A ME-model was used in the workflow to test the designs’ growth-coupled production in addition to a less complex genome-scale metabolic model (M-model). The workflow identified 634 M-model growth-coupled designs which met the filtering criteria and 42 robust designs, which met growth-coupled production criteria using both M and ME-models. Knockouts were found to follow a pattern of controlling intermediate metabolite consumption such as pyruvate consumption and high flux subsystems such as glycolysis. Kinetic parameter sampling using the ME-model revealed how enzyme efficiency and pathway tradeoffs can affect growth-coupled production phenotypes.},

We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy‐chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single‐cell multi‐omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.

Multi‐Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) is a computational framework for unsupervised discovery of the principal axes of biological and technical variation when multiple omics assays are applied to the same samples. MOFA is a broadly applicable approach for multi‐omics data integration.

The inferred latent factors represent the underlying principal axes of heterogeneity across the samples. Factors can be shared by multiple data modalities or can be data‐type specific.The model flexibly handles missing values and different data types.In an application to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, MOFA discovers a low dimensional space spanned by known clinical markers and underappreciated axes of variation such as oxidative stress.In an application to multi‐omics profiles from single‐cells, MOFA recovers differentiation trajectories and identifies coordinated variation between the transcriptome and the epigenome.},

	abstract = {Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)–based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e−6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n = 230, C-index = 0.75), NCI cohort (n = 221, C-index = 0.67), Chinese cohort (n = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n = 40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n = 27, C-index = 0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction. Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1248–59. ©2017 AACR.},

	abstract = {A significant obstacle in training predictive cell models is the lack of integrated data sources. We develop semi-supervised normalization pipelines and perform experimental characterization (growth, transcriptional, proteome) to create Ecomics, a consistent, quality-controlled multi-omics compendium for Escherichia coli with cohesive meta-data information. We then use this resource to train a multi-scale model that integrates four omics layers to predict genome-wide concentrations and growth dynamics. The genetic and environmental ontology reconstructed from the omics data is substantially different and complementary to the genetic and chemical ontologies. The integration of different layers confers an incremental increase in the prediction performance, as does the information about the known gene regulatory and protein-protein interactions. The predictive performance of the model ranges from 0.54 to 0.87 for the various omics layers, which far exceeds various baselines. This work provides an integrative framework of omics-driven predictive modelling that is broadly applicable to guide biological discovery.},

Here, we present GECKO, a method that enhances a GEM to account for enzymes as part of reactions, thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied GECKO to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GEM and demonstrated that the new model could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a specific pathway. GECKO also allows to directly integrate quantitative proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the model, in over 60\% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways.

The GECKO method takes into account enzyme abundances and kinetics to enhance genome‐scale models of metabolism (GEMs). An implementation for Saccharomyces cerevisiae gives insight into metabolism and enzyme usage.

GECKO is a method that enhances a GEM with enzyme constraints, using both kinetic and omics data.The enzyme‐constrained ecYeast7 model of S. cerevisiae outperforms previous models in simulation capabilities and allows exploring enzyme usage.Directly integrating quantitative proteomic data in ecYeast7 significantly reduces the inherent flux variability of model simulations.Physiological behavior such as maximum specific growth rate, overflow metabolism and gene deletion response can be explained by a limited enzyme pool in cell.},

Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, manifested through alterations in metabolites. We performed metabolomic profiling on 138 matched clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)/normal tissue pairs and found that ccRCC is characterized by broad shifts in central carbon metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and antioxidant response. Tumor progression and metastasis were associated with metabolite increases in glutathione and cysteine/methionine metabolism pathways. We develop an analytic pipeline and visualization tool (metabolograms) to bridge the gap between TCGA transcriptomic profiling and our metabolomic data, which enables us to assemble an integrated pathway-level metabolic atlas and to demonstrate discordance between transcriptome and metabolome. Lastly, expression profiling was performed on a high-glutathione cluster, which corresponds to a poor-survival subgroup in the ccRCC TCGA cohort.},

The platform autonomously integrates multiple MS-based metabolomics data types without constraints due to different sample preparation/extraction, chromatographic separation, or MS detection method. This multimodal analysis streamlines the extraction of biological information from the metabolomics data as well as the contextualization within proteomics and transcriptomics data sets. As a proof of concept, this multimodal analysis approach was applied to a colorectal cancer (CRC) study, in which complementary liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) data were combined with proteomic and transcriptomic data. Our approach provided a highly resolved overview of colon cancer metabolic dysregulation, with an average 17\% increase of detected dysregulated metabolites per pathway and an increase in metabolic pathway prediction confidence. Moreover, 95\% of the altered metabolic pathways matched with the dysregulated genes and proteins, providing additional validation at a systems level.

Combined analysis of large data sets characterizing genes, transcripts, and proteins can elucidate biological functions and disease processes. Williams et al. report an exceptionally detailed characterization of mitochondrial function in a genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred mice. They measured the metabolic function of nearly 400 mice under various environmental conditions and collected detailed quantitative information from livers of the animals on over 25,000 transcripts. These data were integrated with quantitation of over 2500 proteins and nearly 1000 metabolites. Such analysis showed a frequent lack of correlation of transcript and protein abundance, enabled the identification of genomic variants of mitochondrial enzymes that caused inborn errors in metabolism, and revealed two genes that appear to function in cholesterol metabolism.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONOver the past two decades, continuous improvements in “omics” technologies have driven an ever-greater capacity to define the relationships between genetics, molecular pathways, and overall phenotypes. Despite this progress, the majority of genetic factors influencing complex traits remain unknown. This is exemplified by mitochondrial supercomplex assembly, a critical component of the electron transport chain, which remains poorly characterized. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have expanded the scope and reliability of proteomics and metabolomics measurements. These tools are now capable of identifying thousands of factors driving diverse molecular pathways, their mechanisms, and consequent phenotypes and thus substantially contribute toward the understanding of complex systems.
RATIONALEGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed many causal loci associated with specific phenotypes, yet the identification of such genetic variants has been generally insufficient to elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking these genetic variants with specific phenotypes. A multitude of control mechanisms differentially affect the cellular concentrations of different classes of biomolecules. Therefore, the identification of the causal mechanisms underlying complex trait variation requires quantitative and comprehensive measurements of multiple layers of data—principally of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites and the integration of the resulting data. Recent technological developments now support such multiple layers of measurements with a high degree of reproducibility across diverse sample or patient cohorts. In this study, we applied a multilayered approach to analyze metabolic phenotypes associated with mitochondrial metabolism.
RESULTSWe profiled metabolic fitness in 386 individuals from 80 cohorts of the BXD mouse genetic reference population across two environmental states. Specifically, this extensive phenotyping program included the analysis of metabolism, mitochondrial function, and cardiovascular function. To understand the variation in these phenotypes, we quantified multiple, detailed layers of systems-scale measurements in the livers of the entire population: the transcriptome (25,136 transcripts), proteome (2622 proteins), and metabolome (981 metabolites). Together with full genomic coverage of the BXDs, these layers provide a comprehensive view on overall variances induced by genetics and environment regarding metabolic activity and mitochondrial function in the BXDs. Among the 2600 transcript-protein pairs identified, 85\% of observed quantitative trait loci uniquely influenced either the transcript or protein level. The transomic integration of molecular data established multiple causal links between genotype and phenotype that could not be characterized by any individual data set. Examples include the link between D2HGDH protein and the metabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, the BCKDHA protein mapping to the gene Bckdhb, the identification of two isoforms of ECI2, and mapping mitochondrial supercomplex assembly to the protein COX7A2L. These respective measured variants in these mitochondrial proteins were in turn associated with varied complex metabolic phenotypes, such as heart rate, cholesterol synthesis, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Of note, our transomics approach clarified the contested role of COX7A2L in mitochondrial supercomplex formation and identified and validated Echdc1 and Mmab as involved in the cholesterol pathway.
CONCLUSIONOverall, these findings indicate that data generated by next-generation proteomics and metabolomics techniques have reached a quality and scope to complement transcriptomics, genomics, and phenomics for transomic analyses of complex traits. Using mitochondria as a case in point, we show that the integrated analysis of these systems provides more insights into the emergence of the observed phenotypes than any layer can by itself, highlighting the complementarity of a multilayered approach. The increasing implementation of these omics technologies as complements, rather than as replacements, will together move us forward in the integrative analysis of complex traits. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/352/6291/aad0189/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Model of the transomics analysis. A transomics approach was taken to analyze genetic and environmental variation in metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes by measuring five distinct layers of biology in a diverse population of BXD mice. The combined analysis of all layers together provides additional information not yielded by any single omics approach.
Recent improvements in quantitative proteomics approaches, including Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS), permit reproducible large-scale protein measurements across diverse cohorts. Together with genomics, transcriptomics, and other technologies, transomic data sets can be generated that permit detailed analyses across broad molecular interaction networks. Here, we examine mitochondrial links to liver metabolism through the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of 386 individuals in the BXD mouse reference population. Several links were validated between genetic variants toward transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes. Among these, sequence variants in Cox7a2l alter its protein’s activity, which in turn leads to downstream differences in mitochondrial supercomplex formation. This data set demonstrates that the proteome can now be quantified comprehensively, serving as a key complement to transcriptomics, genomics, and metabolomics—a combination moving us forward in complex trait analysis.
Advances in mass spectrometry yield insights into mitochondrial function.

The current consensus recognizes four main medulloblastoma subgroups (wingless, Sonic hedgehog, group 3 and group 4). While medulloblastoma subgroups have been characterized extensively at the (epi-)genomic and transcriptomic levels, the proteome and phosphoproteome landscape remain to be comprehensively elucidated. Using quantitative (phospho)-proteomics in primary human medulloblastomas, we unravel distinct posttranscriptional regulation leading to highly divergent oncogenic signaling and kinase activity profiles in groups 3 and 4 medulloblastomas. Specifically, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses identify aberrant ERBB4-SRC signaling in group 4. Hence, enforced expression of an activated SRC combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 medulloblastoma. Therefore, our integrative proteogenomics approach unveils an oncogenic pathway and potential therapeutic vulnerability in the most common medulloblastoma subgroup.},

Second, we show that genome-scale models, based on genomic and bibliomic data, enable quantitative synchronization of disparate data types. Integrating omics data with models enabled the discovery of two novel regularities: condition invariant in vivo turnover rates of enzymes and the correlation of protein structural motifs and translational pausing.

	abstract = {N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) is widely used as a nutraceutical for facilitating infant brain development, maintaining brain health, and enhancing immunity. Currently, NeuAc is mainly produced by extraction from egg yolk and milk, or via chemical synthesis. However, its low concentration in natural resources and its non-ecofriendly chemical synthesis result in insufficient NeuAc production and environmental pollution, respectively. In this study, improved NeuAc production was attained via modular pathway engineering of the supply pathways of two key precursors—N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)—and by balancing NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth in engineered Bacillus subtilis. Specifically, we used a previously constructed GlcNAc-producing B. subtilis as the initial host for NeuAc biosynthesis. First, we constructed a de novo NeuAc biosynthetic pathway utilizing glucose by coexpressing glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyl-transferase (GNA1), N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE), and N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (NeuB), resulting in 0.33 g/l NeuAc production. Next, to balance the supply of the two key precursors for NeuAc biosynthesis, modular pathway engineering was performed. The optimal strategy for balancing the GlcNAc module and PEP supply module involved the use of an engineered, unique glucose and malate coutilization pathway in B. subtilis, supplied with both glucose (for the GlcNAc moiety) and malate (for the PEP moiety) at high strength. This led to 1.65 g/L NeuAc production, representing a 5.0-fold improvement over the existing methods. Furthermore, to enhance the NeuAc yield on cell, glucose and malate coutilization pathways were engineered to balance NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth via the blocking of glycolysis, the introduction of the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and the overexpression of the malic enzyme YtsJ. NeuAc titer reached 2.18 g/L, with 0.38 g/g dry cell weight NeuAc yield on cell, which represented a 1.32-fold and 2.64-fold improvement over the existing methods, respectively. The strategy of modular pathway engineering of key carbon precursor supply pathways via engineering of the unique glucose-malate coutilization pathway in B. subtilis should be generically applicable for engineering of B. subtilis for the production of other important biomolecules. Our study also provides a good starting point for further metabolic engineering to achieve industrial production of NeuAc by a Generally Regarded As Safe bacterial strain.},

	abstract = {Apart from product yield and titer, volumetric productivity is a key performance indicator for many biotechnological processes. Due to the inherent trade-off between the production of biomass as catalyst and of the actual target product, yield and volumetric productivity cannot be optimized simultaneously. Therefore, in combination with genetic techniques for dynamic regulation of metabolic fluxes, two-stage fermentations (TSFs) with separated growth and production phase have recently gained much interest because of their potential to improve the productivity of bioprocesses while still allowing high product yields. However, despite some successful case studies, so far it has not been discussed and analyzed systematically whether or under which conditions a TSF guarantees superior productivity compared to one-stage fermentation (OSF). In this study, we use mathematical models to demonstrate that the volumetric productivity of a TSF is not automatically better than of a corresponding OSF. Our analysis reveals that the sharp decrease of the specific substrate uptake rate usually observed in (non-growth) production phases severely impacts the volumetric productivity and thus raises a big challenge for designing competitive TSF processes. We discuss possible approaches such as enforced ATP wasting to improve substrate utilization rates in the production phase by which TSF processes can become superior to OSF. We also analyze additional factors influencing the relative performance of OSF and TSF and show that OSF processes can be more appropriate if a high product yield is an economic constraint. In conclusion, a careful assessment of the trade-offs between substrate uptake rates, yields, and productivity is necessary when deciding for OSF vs. TSF processes.},

Studies pairing computational predictions with experiments have shown the importance of maintenance energy and proteome allocation in explaining rate-yield tradeoffs and overflow metabolism. Recently, adaptive evolution experiments of Escherichia coli reveal a phenotypic diversity beyond what has been explained using simple models of growth rate versus yield. Here, we identify a two-dimensional rate-yield tradeoff in adapted E.{\textasciitilde}coli strains where the dimensions are (A) a tradeoff between growth rate and yield and (B) a tradeoff between substrate (glucose) uptake rate and growth yield. We employ a multi-scale modeling approach, combining a previously reported coarse-grained small-scale proteome allocation model with a fine-grained genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model), to develop a quantitative description of the full rate-yield relationship for E.{\textasciitilde}coli K-12 MG1655. The multi-scale analysis resolves the complexity of ME-model which hindered its practical use in proteome complexity analysis, and provides a mechanistic explanation of the two-dimensional tradeoff. Further, the analysis identifies modifications to the P/O ratio and the flux allocation between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway as potential mechanisms that enable the tradeoff between glucose uptake rate and growth yield. Thus, the rate-yield tradeoffs that govern microbial adaptation to new environments are more complex than previously reported, and they can be understood in mechanistic detail using a multi-scale modeling approach.},

We experimentally modulate gene expression to ask if this growth law always maximizes growth rate, as has been suggested by theory. We find that the growth law is optimal in many conditions, including a range of perturbations to lactose uptake, but provides sub-optimal growth on several other carbon sources. Combining theory and experiment, we genetically re-engineer E. coli to make sub-optimal conditions into optimal ones and vice versa. We conclude that the carbon growth law is not always optimal, but represents a practical heuristic that often works but sometimes fails.},

When E. coli cells express unneeded protein, they grow more slowly. Such penalty to fitness associated with making proteins is called protein cost. Protein cost is an important component in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underlie the evolution of protein circuits, but its origins are still poorly understood. Here, we ask how the protein cost varies during the exponential growth phase of E. coli. We find that cells growing exponentially following an upshift from overnight culture show a large cost when producing unneeded proteins. However, after several generations, while still in exponential growth, the cells enter a phase where cost is much reduced despite vigorous unneeded protein production. We find that this reduced-cost phase depends on the ppGpp system, which adjusts the amount of ribosomes in the cell and does not occur after a downshift from rich to poor medium. These findings suggest that protein cost is a transient phenomenon that happens upon an upshift in conditions and that cost is reduced when ribosomes and other cellular systems have increased to their appropriate steady-state level in the new condition.},

In the present work, we describe an approach toward exploring such enzyme promiscuity in the space of a metabolic network.

Failed predictions of gene essentiality offer an opportunity for targeting biological discovery, suggesting the presence of unknown underground pathways stemming from enzymatic cross-reactivity. We demonstrate a workflow that couples constraint-based modeling and bioinformatic tools with KO strain analysis and adaptive laboratory evolution for the purpose of predicting promiscuity at the genome scale. Three cases of genes that are incorrectly predicted as essential in Escherichia coli—aspC, argD, and gltA—are examined, and isozyme functions are uncovered for each to a different extent. Seven isozyme functions based on genetic and transcriptional evidence are suggested between the genes aspC and tyrB, argD and astC, gabT and puuE, and gltA and prpC.

Targeted cancer therapies that use genetics are successful, but principles for selectively targeting tumor metabolism that is also dependent on the environment remain unknown. We now show that differences in rate-controlling enzymes during the Warburg effect (WE), the most prominent hallmark of cancer cell metabolism, can be used to predict a response to targeting glucose metabolism. We establish a natural product, koningic acid (KA), to be a selective inhibitor of GAPDH, an enzyme we characterize to have differential control properties over metabolism during the WE. With machine learning and integrated pharmacogenomics and metabolomics, we demonstrate that KA efficacy is not determined by the status of individual genes, but by the quantitative extent of the WE, leading to a therapeutic window in vivo. Thus, the basis of targeting the WE can be encoded by molecular principles that extend beyond the status of individual genes.},

Under natural conditions, bacteria form mixed, interacting communities. Understanding how such communities assemble and stabilize is important in a range of contexts, from biotechnological applications to what happens in our guts. Goldford et al. sampled the microbial communities from soil and plants containing hundreds to thousands of sequence variants. The organisms were passaged after culture in low concentrations of single carbon sources and were cross-fed with each other's metabolites; then, the resulting communities were sequenced using 16S ribosomal RNA, and the outcomes were modeled mathematically. The mix of species that survived under steady conditions converged reproducibly to reflect the experimentally imposed conditions rather than the mix of species initially inoculated—although at coarse phylogenetic levels, taxonomic patterns persisted.
Science, this issue p. 469
A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.
Microbial communities assemble into similar family-level compositions containing divergent genera and species.

Metabolic activity (i.e. rates, flow, or most commonly referred to as flux) is constrained by thermodynamics and regulated by the activity of enzymes. The general principles that relate biological and physical variables to metabolic control are incompletely understood. Using metabolic control analysis in several representative topological structures of metabolic pathways as models, we derive exact results and conduct computer simulations that define relationships between thermodynamics, enzyme activity, and flux control. We confirm that metabolic pathways that are very far from equilibrium are controlled by the activity of upstream enzymes. However, in general, metabolic pathways have a more adaptable pattern of regulation, controlled minimally by thermodynamics and not necessarily by the specific enzyme that generates the given reaction. These findings show how the control of metabolic pathways, which are rarely very far from equilibrium, is largely set by the overall flux through a pathway rather than by the enzyme which generates the flux or by thermodynamics.},

A challenge in solving the genotype-to-phenotype relationship is to predict a cell’s metabolome, believed to correlate poorly with gene expression. Using comparative quantitative proteomics, we found that differential protein expression in 97 Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinase deletion strains is non-redundant and dominated by abundance changes in metabolic enzymes. Associating differential enzyme expression landscapes to corresponding metabolomes using network models provided reasoning for poor proteome-metabolome correlations; differential protein expression redistributes flux control between many enzymes acting in concert, a mechanism not captured by one-to-one correlation statistics. Mapping these regulatory patterns using machine learning enabled the prediction of metabolite concentrations, as well as identification of candidate genes important for the regulation of metabolism. Overall, our study reveals that a large part of metabolism regulation is explained through coordinated enzyme expression changes. Our quantitative data indicate that this mechanism explains more than half of metabolism regulation and underlies the interdependency between enzyme levels and metabolism, which renders the metabolome a predictable phenotype.},

In this work, we revisit two of these methods, namely thermodynamic FBA and loopless FBA, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each one. Finally, we suggest a compromise denoted semi-thermodynamic FBA (st-FBA) which imposes stronger thermodynamic constrains on the flux polytope compared to loopless FBA, without requiring a large set of thermodynamic parameters as in the case of thermodynamic FBA.

When all reactions are reversible, adding the constraints based on equilibrium constants reduces the number of elementary flux modes (EFMs) by a factor of two. Declaring in advance some reactions as irreversible, based on reliable biochemical expertise, can in general reduce the number of EFMs by a greater factor. But, even in this case, computing tEFMs can rule out some EFMs which are biochemically irrelevant. We applied our method to two published models described with binary distinction: the monosaccharide metabolism and the central carbon metabolism of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results show that the binary distinction is in good agreement with biochemical observations.

Thus, metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes are fixed to constant values.

However, without a large number of constraints, many different flux sets can describe the optimal model and we obtain no information on how metabolite levels dynamically change. Thus, to accurately determine what is taking place within the cell, finer quality data and more detailed models need to be constructed.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed E. coli ME-model called iJL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous E. coli ME-models while using 1/6 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in iJL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal in silico media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.},

	abstract = {Allosteric regulation has traditionally been described by mathematically-complex allosteric rate laws in the form of ratios of polynomials derived from the application of simplifying kinetic assumptions. Alternatively, an approach that explicitly describes all known ligand-binding events requires no simplifying assumptions while allowing for the computation of enzymatic states. Here, we employ such a modeling approach to examine the “catalytic potential” of an enzyme—an enzyme’s capacity to catalyze a biochemical reaction. The catalytic potential is the fundamental result of multiple ligand-binding events that represents a “tug of war” among the various regulators and substrates within the network. This formalism allows for the assessment of interacting allosteric enzymes and development of a network-level understanding of regulation. We first define the catalytic potential and use it to characterize the response of three key kinases (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase) in human red blood cell glycolysis to perturbations in ATP utilization. Next, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential by using existing personalized models, finding that the catalytic potential allows for the identification of subtle but important differences in how individuals respond to such perturbations. Finally, we explore how the catalytic potential can help to elucidate how enzymes work in tandem to maintain a homeostatic state. Taken together, this work provides an interpretation and visualization of the dynamic interactions and network-level effects of interacting allosteric enzymes.},

Glycolysis is upregulated under conditions such as hypoxia and high energy demand to promote cell proliferation, although the mechanism remains poorly understood. We find that hypoxia in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces concentration of glycolytic enzymes, including the Pfk2p subunit of the rate-limiting phosphofructokinase, into a single, non-membrane-bound granule termed the “glycolytic body” or “G body.” A yeast kinome screen identifies the yeast ortholog of AMP-activated protein kinase, Snf1p, as necessary for G-body formation. Many G-body components identified by proteomics are required for G-body integrity. Cells incapable of forming G bodies in hypoxia display abnormal cell division and produce inviable daughter cells. Conversely, cells with G bodies show increased glucose consumption and decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates. Importantly, G bodies form in human hepatocarcinoma cells in hypoxia. Together, our results suggest that G body formation is a conserved, adaptive response to increase glycolytic output during hypoxia or tumorigenesis.},

(1973) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545–565]. A substantial fraction of this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20 amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74 high-energy phosphate bonds per molecule. The energetic advantage to encoding a less costly amino acid in a highly expressed gene can be greater than 0.025\% of the total energy budget. Here, we provide evidence that amino acid composition in the proteomes of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis reflects the action of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. We employ synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates and show increases in the abundance of less energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.},

The formation of patterns permits the maintenance of larger overall biomass at low rainfall rates compared with homogeneous vegetation. This results in a bias of models run at larger scales neglecting subgrid-scale variability. In the present study, we investigate the question whether subgrid-scale heterogeneity can be parameterized as the outcome of optimal partitioning between bare soil and vegetated area. We find that a two-box model reproduces the time-averaged biomass of the patterns emerging in a 100 × 100 grid model if the vegetated fraction is optimized for maximum entropy production (MEP). This suggests that the proposed optimality-based representation of subgrid-scale heterogeneity may be generally applicable to different systems and at different scales. The implications for our understanding of self-organized behaviour and its modelling are discussed.},

We have recently shown that in the most likely metabolic state the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution law while complying with the principle of maximum entropy production. To demonstrate that a metabolic network evolves towards such state we have carried out adaptive evolution experiments with Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum operating with a reduced metabolic functionality based on a reduced set of elementary modes. In such reduced metabolic network metabolic fluxes can be conveniently computed from the measured metabolite secretion pattern. Over a time span of 300 generations the specific growth rate of the strain continuously increased together with a continuous increase in the rate of entropy production. We show that the rate of entropy production asymptotically approaches the maximum entropy production rate predicted from the state when the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, the outcome of evolution of a complex biological system can be predicted in highly quantitative terms using basic statistical mechanical principles.},

In the state with maximal density of entropy production the optimal enzyme rate constants, the stationary concentrations of the substrate and the product, the stationary product yield as well as the stationary reaction flux are calculated. The test, whether these calculated values of the reaction parameters are consistent with their corresponding measured values, is performed for the enzyme Glucose Isomerase. It is found that calculated and measured rate constants agree within an order of magnitude, whereas the calculated reaction flux and the product yield differ from their corresponding measured values for less than 20 \% and 5 \%, respectively.

We used dynamic optimization to investigate the influence of toxic intermediates in connection with the efficiency of enzymes on the regulation of a linear metabolic pathway. Our results predict that transcriptional regulation favors the control of highly efficient enzymes with less toxic upstream intermediates to reduce accumulation of toxic downstream intermediates. We show that the derived optimality principles hold by the analysis of the interplay between intermediate toxicity and pathway regulation in the metabolic pathways of over 5000 sequenced prokaryotes. Moreover, using the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli as an example, we show how knowledge about the relation of regulation, kinetic efficiency and intermediate toxicity can be used to identify drug targets, which control endogenous toxic metabolites and prevent microbial growth.

Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational metabolite identification by a considerable margin.},

RNA profiles are an informative phenotype of cellular and tissue states but can be costly to generate at massive scale. Here, we describe how gene expression levels can be efficiently acquired with random composite measurements—in which abundances are combined in a random weighted sum. We show (1) that the similarity between pairs of expression profiles can be approximated with very few composite measurements; (2) that by leveraging sparse, modular representations of gene expression, we can use random composite measurements to recover high-dimensional gene expression levels (with 100 times fewer measurements than genes); and (3) that it is possible to blindly recover gene expression from composite measurements, even without access to training data. Our results suggest new compressive modalities as a foundation for massive scaling in high-throughput measurements and new insights into the interpretation of high-dimensional data.},

	abstract = {Background The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has recently attracted great interest as the first example of a cloned reporter protein that is intrinsically fluorescent. Although successful in some organisms, heterologous expression of GFP has not always been straight forward. In particular, expression of GFP in cells that require incubation temperatures around 37°C has been problematic. Results We have carried out a screen for mutant forms of GFP that fluoresce more intensely than the wild-type protein when expressed in E. coli at 37°C. We have characterized a bright mutant (GFPA) with reduced sensitivity to temperature in both bacteria and yeast, and have shown that the amino acids substituted in GFPA act by preventing temperature-dependent misfolding of the GFP apoprotein. We have shown that the excitation and emission spectra of GFPA can be manipulated by site-directed mutagenesis without disturbing its improved folding characteristics, and have produced a thermostable folding mutant (GFP5) that can be efficiently excited using either long-wavelength ultraviolet or blue light. Expression of GFP5 results in greatly improved levels of fluorescence in both microbial and mammalian cells cultured at 37°C. Conclusions The thermotolerant mutants of GFP greatly improve the sensitivity of the protein as a visible reporter molecule in bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells. The fluorescence spectra of these mutants can be manipulated by further mutagenesis without deleteriously affecting their improved folding characteristics, so it may be possible to engineer a range of spectral variants with improved tolerance to temperature. Such a range of sensitive reporter proteins will greatly improve the prospects for GFP-based applications in cells that require relatively high incubation temperatures.},

However, it has been challenging to directly observe these complexes and their functional roles in living systems. In this work, we have used wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the spatial organization of metabolic enzymes participating in glucose metabolism in human cells. We provide compelling evidence that human liver-type phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKL), which catalyzes a bottleneck step of glycolysis, forms various sizes of cytoplasmic clusters in human cancer cells, independent of protein expression levels and of the choice of fluorescent tags. We also report that these PFKL clusters colocalize with other rate-limiting enzymes in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, supporting the formation of multienzyme complexes. Subsequent biophysical characterizations with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) corroborate the formation of multienzyme metabolic complexes in living cells, which appears to be controlled by post-translational acetylation on PFKL. Importantly, quantitative high-content imaging assays indicated that the direction of glucose flux between glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and serine biosynthesis seem to be spatially regulated by the multienzyme complexes in a cluster size-dependent manner. Collectively, our results reveal a functionally relevant, multienzyme metabolic complex for glucose metabolism in living human cells.},

Eukaryotic compartmentalization within mitochondria and peroxisomes and substrate tunneling within multi-enzyme complexes have been well recognized. Intriguingly, the central pathways in prokaryotes may also form extensive channels, including the heavily branched glycolysis pathway. In vivo channeling through cascade enzymes is difficult to directly measure, but can be inferred from in vitro tests, reaction thermodynamics, transport/reaction modeling, analysis of molecular diffusion and protein interactions, or steady state/dynamic isotopic labeling. Channeling presents challenges but also opportunities for metabolic engineering applications. It rigidifies fluxes in native pathways by trapping or excluding metabolites for bioconversions, causing substrate catabolite repressions or inferior efficiencies in engineered pathways. Channeling is an overlooked regulatory mechanism used to control flux responses under environmental/genetic perturbations. The heterogeneous distribution of intracellular enzymes also confounds kinetic modeling and multiple-omics analyses. Understanding the scope and mechanisms of channeling in central pathways may improve our interpretation of robust fluxomic topology throughout metabolic networks and lead to better design and engineering of heterologous pathways.},

We apply microfluidic and fluorescent spectroscopy techniques to study the coordinated movement of the first four enzymes of the glycolysis cascade: hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase.

In total, we identify 3,322 unique residue-to-residue contacts involving half of the mitochondrial proteome detected by bottom-up proteomics. The obtained mitochondrial protein interactome gives insights in the architecture and submitochondrial localization of defined protein assemblies, and reveals the mitochondrial localization of four proteins not yet included in the MitoCarta database. As one of the highlights, we show that the oxidative phosphorylation complexes I-V exist in close spatial proximity, providing direct evidence for supercomplex assembly in intact mitochondria. The specificity of these contacts is demonstrated by comparative analysis of mitochondria after high salt treatment, which disrupts the native supercomplexes and substantially changes the mitochondrial interactome.},

Aside from being highly accessible and informative in laboratory cultures, maximal growth rate is often a prime determinant of cellular fitness, and predicting phenotypes that underlie fitness is key to both understanding and manipulating life. Despite this, current methods for predicting microbial fitness typically focus on yields [e.g., predictions of biomass yield using GEnome-scale metabolic Models (GEMs)] or notably require many empirical kinetic constants or substrate uptake rates, which render these methods ineffective in cases where fitness derives most directly from growth rate. Here we present a new method for predicting cellular growth rate, termed SUMEX, which does not require any empirical variables apart from a metabolic network (i.e., a GEM) and the growth medium. SUMEX is calculated by maximizing the SUM of molar EXchange fluxes (hence SUMEX) in a genome-scale metabolic model. SUMEX successfully predicts relative microbial growth rates across species, environments, and genetic conditions, outperforming traditional cellular objectives (most notably, the convention assuming biomass maximization). The success of SUMEX suggests that the ability of a cell to catabolize substrates and produce a strong proton gradient enables fast cell growth. Easily applicable heuristics for predicting growth rate, such as what we demonstrate with SUMEX, may contribute to numerous medical and biotechnological goals, ranging from the engineering of faster-growing industrial strains, modeling of mixed ecological communities, and the inhibition of cancer growth.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our understanding of bacterial cell size control is based mainly on stress-free growth conditions in the laboratory [1–10]. In the real world, however, bacteria are routinely faced with stresses that produce long filamentous cell morphologies [11–28]. \textit{Escherichia coli} is observed to filament in response to DNA damage [22–25], antibiotic treatment [11–14, 28], host immune systems [15, 16], temperature [17], starvation [20], and more [18, 19, 21], conditions which are relevant to clinical settings and food preservation [26]. This shape plasticity is considered a survival strategy [27]. Size control in this regime remains largely unexplored. Here we report that \textit{E. coli} cells use a dynamic size ruler to determine division locations combined with an adder-like mechanism to trigger divisions. As filamentous cells increase in size due to growth, or decrease in size due to divisions, its multiple Fts division rings abruptly reorganize to remain one characteristic cell length away from the cell pole and two such length units away from each other. These rules can be explained by spatiotemporal oscillations of Min proteins. Upon removal of filamentation stress, the cells undergo a sequence of division events, randomly at one of the possible division sites, on average after the time required to grow one characteristic cell size. These results indicate that \textit{E. coli} cells continuously keep track of absolute length to control size, suggest a wider relevance for the adder principle beyond the control of normally sized cells, and provide a new perspective on the function of the Fts and Min systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Summary
Altered glycolysis is a hallmark of diseases including diabetes and cancer. Despite intensive study of the contributions of individual glycolytic enzymes, systems-level analyses of flux control through glycolysis remain limited. Here, we overexpress in two mammalian cell lines the individual enzymes catalyzing each of the 12 steps linking extracellular glucose to excreted lactate, and find substantial flux control at four steps: glucose import, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate export (and not at any steps of lower glycolysis). The four flux-controlling steps are specifically upregulated by the Ras oncogene: optogenetic Ras activation rapidly induces the transcription of isozymes catalyzing these four steps and enhances glycolysis. At least one isozyme catalyzing each of these four steps is consistently elevated in human tumors. Thus, in the studied contexts, flux control in glycolysis is concentrated in four key enzymatic steps. Upregulation of these steps in tumors likely underlies the Warburg effect.},

Both enzymes were purified from recombinant E. coli and shown to be active as fructose 1,6-bisphosphatases (FBPases). The FBPase-negative Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant Δfbp could be phenotypically complemented with glpXC and glpXP from B. methanolicus. GlpXP and GlpXC share similar functional properties, as they were here found to be active as homotetramers in vitro, activated by Mn2+ ions and inhibited by Li+, but differed in terms of the kinetic parameters. GlpXC showed much higher catalytic efficiency and a lower KM for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (86.3 s—1 mM—1 and 14±0.5 μM) than GlpXP (8.8 s—1 mM—1 and 440±7.6 μM), indicating that GlpXC is the major FBPase of B. methanolicus. Both enzymes were tested for activity as sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) since a SBPase variant of the ribulose monophosphate cycle has been proposed for B. methanolicus. The substrate for SBPase reaction, sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, could be synthesized in vitro using both fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase proteins from B. methanolicus. Evidence for activity as SBPase could be obtained for GlpXP, but not for GlpXC. Based on these in vitro data GlpXP is a promiscuous SBPase/FBPase and might function in the RuMP cycle of B. methanolicus.},

Genome-metabolism interactions enable cell growth. To probe the extent of these interactions and delineate their functional contributions, we quantified the Saccharomyces amino acid metabolome and its response to systematic gene deletion. Over one-third of coding genes, in particular those important for chromatin dynamics, translation, and transport, contribute to biosynthetic metabolism. Specific amino acid signatures characterize genes of similar function. This enabled us to exploit functional metabolomics to connect metabolic regulators to their effectors, as exemplified by TORC1, whose inhibition in exponentially growing cells is shown to match an interruption in endomembrane transport. Providing orthogonal information compared to physical and genetic interaction networks, metabolomic signatures cluster more than half of the so far uncharacterized yeast genes and provide functional annotation for them. A major part of coding genes is therefore participating in gene-metabolism interactions that expose the metabolism regulatory network and enable access to an underexplored space in gene function.},

To explore the general nature of metabolic self-inhibition, we surveyed enzymological data accrued from a century of experimentation and generated a genome-scale enzyme-inhibition network. Enzyme inhibition is often driven by essential metabolites, affects the majority of biochemical processes, and is executed by a structured network whose topological organization is reflecting chemical similarities that exist between metabolites. Most inhibitory interactions are competitive, emerge in the close neighbourhood of the inhibited enzymes, and result from structural similarities between substrate and inhibitors. Structural constraints also explain one-third of allosteric inhibitors, a finding rationalized by crystallographic analysis of allosterically inhibited L-lactate dehydrogenase. Our findings suggest that the primary cause of metabolic enzyme inhibition is not the evolution of regulatory metabolite–enzyme interactions, but a finite structural diversity prevalent within the metabolome. In eukaryotes, compartmentalization minimizes inevitable enzyme inhibition and alleviates constraints that self-inhibition places on metabolism.},

One reason is that experiments conducted in different laboratories can typically not to be combined without restriction. Second, the interpretation of multi-omic datasets represents a significant challenge by nature, as the biological datasets are heterogeneous not only for technical, but also for biological, chemical, and physical reasons. Here, multi-layer network theory and methods of artificial intelligence might contribute to solve these problems.

Therefore, global carbon and energy efficiency is in essence fixed with no opportunities to identify more efficient routes for recycling carbon flux closer to the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a two-stage computational procedure that both identifies the optimum overall stoichiometry (i.e., optStoic) and selects for (non-)native reactions (i.e., minRxn/minFlux) that maximize carbon, energy or price efficiency while satisfying thermodynamic feasibility requirements. Implementation for recent pathway design studies identified non-intuitive designs with improved efficiencies. Specifically, multiple alternatives for non-oxidative glycolysis are generated and non-intuitive ways of co-utilizing carbon dioxide with methanol are revealed for the production of C2+ metabolites with higher carbon efficiency.},

The result was that half of the free-energy difference should be converted into free-energy of ATP and the remaining half should be used to drive the pathway. The calculated stoichiometry is in agreement with the observed yield of two moles of ATP per mole of glucose. Using the same approach, we here analyse eight other metabolic pathways. Although the deviation is not very large, the calculated values do not fit as nicely as for glycolysis as leading to lactate. For example, for O2 respiration, the theoretical ATP yield equals 27.9. The real value varies among organisms between 26 and 38. For mixed-acid fermentation in Escherichia coli, the theoretical and experimental values are 2.24 and 2, respectively. For arginine degradation in M. pneumoniae, the calculated value is 2.43 mol of ATP, while in vivo only one mole is produced. During evolution, some pathways may not have reached their optimal ATP net production because energy yield is not their only function.

The E. coli proteome is more thermostable than the human one, with protein thermostability depending on protein subcellular location.Subunits of protein complexes residing in one compartment melt similarly, while protein complexes spanning compartments often have their subunits melting in a location‐wise manner.Knockout of tolC led to the thermal destabilization of its interaction partners, the downregulation of a major porin (OmpF), and increased periplasmic stress.},

We can guarantee the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state assuming only two conditions; that every reaction is mass balanced and that continuous kinetic reaction rate laws never lead to a negative molecule concentration. These conditions can be verified in polynomial time and are flexible enough to permit one to force a system away from equilibrium. With expository biochemical examples we show how reversible, mass balanced perpetual reaction(s), with thermodynamically infeasible kinetic parameters, can be used to perpetually force various kinetic models in a manner consistent with the existence of a steady state.

The recent availability of high-throughput technology data sets in biology has paved the way for new modelling approaches at various levels of complexity including the metabolome of a cell or an organism. Understanding the metabolism of a single cell and multi-cell organism will provide the knowledge for the rational design of growth conditions to produce commercially valuable reagents in biotechnology. Here, we demonstrate how equations representing steady state mass conservation, energy conservation, the second law of thermodynamics, and reversible enzyme kinetics can be formulated as a single system of linear equalities and inequalities, in addition to linear equalities on exponential variables. Even though the feasible set is non-convex, the reformulation is exact and amenable to large-scale numerical analysis, a prerequisite for computationally feasible genome scale modelling. Integrating flux, concentration and kinetic variables in a unified constraint-based formulation is aimed at increasing the quantitative predictive capacity of flux balance analysis. Incorporation of experimental and theoretical bounds on thermodynamic and kinetic variables ensures that the predicted steady state fluxes are both thermodynamically and biochemically feasible. The resulting in silico predictions are tested against fluxomic data for central metabolism in Escherichia coli and compare favourably with in silico prediction by flux balance analysis.},

	abstract = {Constraint-based modeling is an approach for quantitative prediction of net reaction flux in genome-scale biochemical networks. In vivo, the second law of thermodynamics requires that net macroscopic flux be forward, when the transformed reaction Gibbs energy is negative. We calculate the latter by using (i) group contribution estimates of metabolite species Gibbs energy, combined with (ii) experimentally measured equilibrium constants. In an application to a genome-scale stoichiometric model of Escherichia coli metabolism, iAF1260, we demonstrate that quantitative prediction of reaction directionality is increased in scope and accuracy by integration of both data sources, transformed appropriately to in vivo pH, temperature and ionic strength. Comparison of quantitative versus qualitative assignment of reaction directionality in iAF1260, assuming an accommodating reactant concentration range of 0.02–20mM, revealed that quantitative assignment leads to a low false positive, but high false negative, prediction of effectively irreversible reactions. The latter is partly due to the uncertainty associated with group contribution estimates. We also uncovered evidence that the high intracellular concentration of glutamate in E. coli may be essential to direct otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable essential reactions, such as the leucine transaminase reaction, in an anabolic direction.},

For each reaction, ΔG is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and ΔG for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with ΔG near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and ΔG are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.},

	abstract = {The response of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism to genetic and environmental manipulation has been studied by use of a recently developed methodology for metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis; this methodology can also directly reveal active metabolic pathways. Generation of fluxome data arrays by use of the METAFoR approach is based on two-dimensional13C-1H correlation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with fractionally labeled biomass and, in contrast to metabolic flux analysis, does not require measurements of extracellular substrate and metabolite concentrations. METAFoR analyses of E. coli strains that moderately overexpress phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, or alcohol dehydrogenase revealed that only a few flux ratios change in concert with the overexpression of these enzymes. Disruption of both pyruvate kinase isoenzymes resulted in altered flux ratios for reactions connecting the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate pools but did not significantly alter central metabolism. These data indicate remarkable robustness and rigidity in central carbon metabolism in the presence of genetic variation. More significant physiological changes and flux ratio differences were seen in response to altered environmental conditions. For example, in ammonia-limited chemostat cultures, compared to glucose-limited chemostat cultures, a reduced fraction of PEP molecules was derived through at least one transketolase reaction, and there was a higher relative contribution of anaplerotic PEP carboxylation than of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for oxaloacetate synthesis. These two parameters also showed significant variation between aerobic and anaerobic batch cultures. Finally, two reactions catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase and malic enzyme were identified by METAFoR analysis; these had previously been considered absent in E. colicells grown in glucose-containing media. Backward flux from the TCA cycle to glycolysis, as indicated by significant activity of PEP carboxykinase, was found only in glucose-limited chemostat culture, demonstrating that control of this futile cycle activity is relaxed under severe glucose limitation.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the validity of the linlog approach, which was recently developed in our laboratory, by comparison of two different kinetic models for the metabolic network of Escherichia coli. The first model is a complete mechanistic model; the second is an approximative model in which linlog kinetics are applied. The parameters of the linlog model (elasticities) are derived from the mechanistic model. Three different optimization cases are examined. In all cases, the objective is to calculate the enzyme levels that maximize a certain flux while keeping the total amount of enzyme constant and preventing large changes of metabolite concentrations. For an average variation of metabolite levels of 10\% and individual changes of a factor 2, the predicted enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations and fluxes of both models are highly similar. This similarity holds for changes in enzyme level of a factor 4–6 and for changes in fluxes up to a factor 6. In all three cases, the predicted optimal enzyme levels could neither have been found by intuition-based approaches, nor on basis of flux control coefficients. This demonstrates that kinetic models are essential tools in Metabolic Engineering. In this respect, the linlog approach is a valuable extension of MCA, since it allows construction of kinetic models, based on MCA parameters, that can be used for constrained optimization problems and are valid for large changes of metabolite and enzyme levels.},

The bacteria were cultivated on glucose limited minimal medium using the accelerostat method (A-stat) where starting from steady state conditions (chemostat culture) dilution rate is constantly increased. At specific growth rate (μ) 0.47h−1, E. coli had focused its metabolism to glucose utilization by down-regulation of alternative substrate transporters expression compared to μ=0.3h−1. It was found that acetic acid accumulation began at μ=0.34±0.01h−1 and two acetate synthesis pathways – phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (pta-ackA) and pyruvate oxidase (poxB) – contributed to the synthesis at the beginning of overflow metabolism, i.e. onset of acetate excretion. On the other hand, poxB, pta and ackA expression patterns suggest that pyruvate oxidase may be the only enzyme synthesizing acetate at μ=0.47h−1. Loss of glucose and acetate co-utilization represented by down-regulation of acs-yjcH-actP operon between specific growth rates 0.3–0.42h−1 and acetic acid accumulation from μ=0.34±0.01h−1 allows one to surmise that the acetate utilization operon expression might play an important role in overflow metabolism.},

	abstract = {A significant goal in the post-genome era is to relate the annotated genome sequence to the physiological functions of a cell. Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype-phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

	abstract = {One of the accepted characterizations of the living state is that it is complex to an extraordinary degree. Since our current understanding of the living condition is minimal and fragmentary, it is not surprising that our first descriptions are simplistic. However, in certain areas of metabolism, especially those that have been amenable to experimentation for the longest period of time, the simplistic explanations have been the most difficult to revise. For example, current texts of general biochemistry still view metabolism as occurring by a series of independent enzymes dispersed in a uniform aqueous environment. This notion has been shown to be deeply flawed by both experimental and theoretical considerations. Thus, there is ample evidence that, in many metabolic pathways, specific interactions between sequential enzymes occur as static and/or dynamic complexes. In addition, reversible interactions of enzymes with structural proteins and membranes is a common occurrence. The interactions of enzymes give rise to a higher level of complexity that must be accounted for when one wishes to understand the regulation of metabolism. One of the phenomena that occurs because of sequential enzyme interactions is the process of channeling. This article discusses enzyme interactions and channeling and summarizes experimental and theoretical results from a few well-studied examples.},

	abstract = {A platform has been developed to measure the activity of 23 enzymes that are involved in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Activities are assayed in optimized stopped assays and the product then determined using a suite of enzyme cycling assays. The platform requires inexpensive equipment, is organized in a modular manner to optimize logistics, calculates results automatically, combines high sensitivity with throughput, can be robotized, and has a throughput of three to four activities in 100 samples per person/day. Several of the assays, including those for sucrose phosphate synthase, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, glycerokinase, and shikimate dehydrogenase, provide large advantages over previous approaches. This platform was used to analyze the diurnal changes of enzyme activities in wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and the starchless plastid phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutant, and in Col-0 during a prolongation of the night. The changes of enzyme activities were compared with the changes of transcript levels determined with the Affymetrix ATH1 array. Changes of transcript levels typically led to strongly damped changes of enzyme activity. There was no relation between the amplitudes of the diurnal changes of transcript and enzyme activity. The largest diurnal changes in activity were found for AGPase and nitrate reductase. Examination of the data and comparison with the literature indicated that these are mainly because of posttranslational regulation. The changes of enzyme activity are also strongly delayed, with the delay varying from enzyme to enzyme. It is proposed that enzyme activities provide a quasi-stable integration of regulation at several levels and provide useful data for the characterization and diagnosis of different physiological states. As an illustration, a decision tree constructed using data from Col-0 during diurnal changes and a prolonged dark treatment was used to show that, irrespective of the time of harvest during the diurnal cycle, the pgm mutant resembles a wild-type plant that has been exposed to a 3 d prolongation of the night.},

	abstract = {The major cell-surface carbohydrates (lipooligosaccharide, capsule, and glycoprotein N-linked heptasaccharide) of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 contain Gal and/or GalNAc residues. GalE is the sole annotated UDP-glucose 4-epimerase in this bacterium. The presence of GalNAc residues in these carbohydrates suggested that GalE might be a UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase. GalE was shown to epimerize UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc in coupled assays with C. jejuni glycosyltransferases and in sugar nucleotide epimerization equilibria studies. Thus, GalE possesses UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase activity and was renamed Gne. The Km(app) values of a purified MalE-Gne fusion protein for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc are 1087 and 1070 microm, whereas those for UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal are 780 and 784 microm. The kcat and kcat/Km(app) values were three to four times higher for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal than for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc. The comparison of the kinetic parameters of MalE-Gne to those of other characterized bacterial UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerases indicated that Gne is a bifunctional UDP-GlcNAc/Glc 4-epimerase. The UDP sugar-binding site of Gne was modeled by using the structure of the UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase WbpP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Small differences were noted, and these may explain the bifunctional character of the C. jejuni Gne. In a gne mutant of C. jejuni, the lipooligosaccharide was shown by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to be truncated by at least five sugars. Furthermore, both the glycoprotein N-linked heptasaccharide and capsule were no longer detectable by high resolution magic angle spinning NMR. These data indicate that Gne is the enzyme providing Gal and GalNAc residues with the synthesis of all three cell-surface carbohydrates in C. jejuni NCTC 11168.},

	abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

TNT resulted to be the most efficient nitro substrate and was reduced to hydroxylamino-dinitrotoluene. Both NADH and NADPH could serve as electron donors of AZR, where the latter was preferred. Externally added FMN was also reduced by AZR via ping-pong mechanism and was a competitive inhibitor of NADPH, methyl red, and nitrofurazone.

The Neighbor-Joining method was used to determine phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotic and eukaryotic UDPG-DHs. UgdG from S. elodea and UDPG-DHs from Novosphingobium, Zymomonas, Agrobacterium, and Caulobacter species form a divergent phylogenetic group with a close evolutionary relationship with eukaryotic UDPG-DHs. The ugdG gene was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli with and N-terminal 6-His tag and purified for biochemical characterization. The enzyme has an optimum temperature and pH of 37 degrees C and 8.7, respectively. The estimated apparent K(m) values for UDP-glucose and NAD(+) were 0.87 and 0.4 mM, respectively.

	abstract = {A psychrophilic gram-positive isolate was obtained from Antarctic Dry Valley soil. It utilized lactose, had a rod-coccus cycle, and contained lysine as the diamino acid in its cell wall. Consistent with these physiological traits, the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence showed that it was phylogenetically related to other Arthrobacter species. A gene (bgaS) encoding a family 2 beta-galactosidase was cloned from this organism into an Escherichia coli host. Preliminary results showed that the enzyme was cold active (optimal activity at 18 degrees C and 50\% activity remaining at 0 degrees C) and heat labile (inactivated within 10 min at 37 degrees C). To enable rapid purification, vectors were constructed adding histidine residues to the BgaS enzyme and its E. coli LacZ counterpart, which was purified for comparison. The His tag additions reduced the specific activities of both beta-galactosidases but did not alter the other characteristics of the enzymes. Kinetic studies using o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside showed that BgaS with and without a His tag had greater catalytic activity at and below 20 degrees C than the comparable LacZ beta-galactosidases. The BgaS heat lability was investigated by ultracentrifugation, where the active enzyme was a homotetramer at 4 degrees C but dissociated into inactive monomers at 25 degrees C. Comparisons of family 2 beta-galactosidase amino acid compositions and modeling studies with the LacZ structure did not mimic suggested trends for conferring enzyme flexibility at low temperatures, consistent with the changes affecting thermal adaptation being localized and subtle. Mutation studies of the BgaS enzyme should aid our understanding of such specific, localized changes affecting enzyme thermal properties.},

	abstract = {The yield potential (Yp) of a grain crop is the seed mass per unit ground area obtained under optimum growing conditions without weeds, pests and diseases. It is determined by the product of the available light energy and by the genetically determined properties: efficiency of light capture (epsilon i), the efficiency of conversion of the intercepted light into biomass (epsilon c) and the proportion of biomass partitioned into grain (eta). Plant breeding brings eta7 and epsilon i close to their theoretical maxima, leaving epsilon c, primarily determined by photosynthesis, as the only remaining major prospect for improving Yp. Leaf photosynthetic rate, however, is poorly correlated with yield when different genotypes of a crop species are compared. This led to the viewpoint that improvement of leaf photosynthesis has little value for improving Yp. By contrast, the many recent experiments that compare the growth of a genotype in current and future projected elevated [CO2] environments show that increase in leaf photosynthesis is closely associated with similar increases in yield. Are there opportunities to achieve similar increases by genetic manipulation? Six potential routes of increasing epsilon c by improving photosynthetic efficiency were explored, ranging from altered canopy architecture to improved regeneration of the acceptor molecule for CO2. Collectively, these changes could improve epsilon c and, therefore, Y p by c. 50\%. Because some changes could be achieved by transgenic technology, the time of the development of commercial cultivars could be considerably less than by conventional breeding and potentially, within 10-15 years.},

	abstract = {The D1 and D2 proteins of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center are stable in the dark, while rapid degradation occurs in the light. Thus far, a quantitative correlation between degradation and photon fluences has not been determined. In Spirodela oligorrhiza, D1-D2 degradation increases with photon flux. We find that kinetics for D2 degradation mirror those for D1, except that the actual half-life times of the D2 protein are about three times larger than those of the D1. The degradation ratio, D2/D1, is fluence independent, supporting the proposal [Jansen, M.A.K., Greenberg, B.M., Edelman, M., Mattoo, A.K. \& Gaba, V. (1996), Photochem. Photobiol.63, 8142013817] that degradation of the two proteins is coupled. It is commonly conceived that D1 degradation is predominantly associated with photon fluences that are supersaturating for photosynthesis. We now show that a fluence as low as 5 µmol·m22122·s22121 elicited a reaction constituting \&gt; 25\% of the total degradation response, while \&gt; 90\% of the degradation potential was attained at intensities below saturation for photosynthesis (2248750 µmol·m22122·s22121). Thus, in intact plants, D1 degradation is overwhelmingly associated with fluences limiting for photosynthesis. D1 degradation increases with photon flux in a complex, multiphasic manner. Four phases were uncovered over the fluence range from 020131600 µmol·m22122·s22121. The multiphasic saturation kinetics underscore that the D1 and D2 degradation response is complex, and emanates from more than one parameter. The physiological processes associated with each phase remain to be determined.},

	abstract = {The structural design of ATP and NADH producing systems, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (TCA), is analysed using optimization principles. It is assumed that these pathways combined with oxidative phosphorylation have reached, during their evolution, a high efficiency with respect to ATP production rates. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic principles, conclusions are derived concerning the optimal stoichiometry of such pathways. Extending previous investigations, both the concentrations of adenine nucleotides as well as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides are considered variable quantities. This implies the consideration of the interaction of an ATP and NADH producing system, an ATP consuming system, a system coupling NADH consumption with ATP production and a system consuming NADH decoupled from ATP production. It is examined in what respect real metabolic pathways can be considered optimal by studying a large number of alternative pathways. The kinetics of the individual reactions are described by linear or bilinear functions of reactant concentrations. In this manner, the steady-state ATP production rate can be calculated for any possible ATP and NADH producing pathway. It is shown that most of the possible pathways result in a very low ATP production rate and that the very efficient pathways share common structural properties. Optimization with respect to the ATP production rate is performed by an evolutionary algorithm. The following results of our analysis are in close correspondence to the real design of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. (1) In all efficient pathways the ATP consuming reactions are located near the beginning. (2) In all efficient pathways NADH producing reactions as well as ATP producing reactions are located near the end. (3) The number of NADH molecules produced by the consumption of one energy-rich molecule (glucose) amounts to four in all efficient pathways. A distance measure and a measure for the internal ordering of reactions are introduced to study differences and similarities in the stoichiometries of metabolic pathways.},

	abstract = {A new method for the mathematical analysis of large metabolic networks is presented. Based on the fact that the occurrence of a metabolic reaction generally requires the existence of other reactions providing its substrates, series of metabolic networks are constructed. In each step of the corresponding expansion process those reactions are incorporated whose substrates are made available by the networks of the previous generations. The method is applied to the set of all metabolic reactions included in the KEGG database. Starting with one or more seed compounds, the expansion results in a final network whose compounds define the scope of the seed. Scopes of all metabolic compounds are calculated and it is shown that large parts of cellular metabolism can be considered as the combined scope of simple building blocks. Analyses of various expansion processes reveal crucial metabolites whose incorporation allows for the increase in network complexity. Among these metabolites are common cofactors such as NAD+, ATP, and coenzyme A. We demonstrate that the outcome of network expansion is in general very robust against elimination of single or few reactions. There exist, however, crucial reactions whose elimination results in a dramatic reduction of scope sizes. It is hypothesized that the expansion process displays characteristics of the evolution of metabolism such as the temporal order of the emergence of metabolic pathways.},

In anoxic chemostat culture at four dilution rates and two different oxidoreduction potentials (ORP), this strain generated a spectrum of products which depended on ORP. Whatever the dilution rate tested, in low reducing conditions ([-]100 mV), the production of formate, acetate, ethanol, and lactate was in molar proportions of approximately 2.5:1:1:0.3, and in high reducing conditions ([-]320 mV), the production was in molar proportions of 2:0.6:1:2. The modification of metabolic fluxes was due to an ORP effect on the synthesis or stability of some fermentation enzymes; thus, in high reducing conditions, lactate dehydrogenase-specific activity increased by a factor of 3 to 6. Those modifications were concomitant with a threefold decrease in acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) needed for biomass synthesis and a 0.5- to 5-fold decrease in formate flux. Calculations of carbon and cofactor balances have shown that fermentation was balanced and that extracellular ORP did not modify the oxidoreduction state of cofactors. From this, it was concluded that extracellular ORP could regulate both some specific enzyme activities and the acetyl-CoA needed for biomass synthesis, which modifies metabolic fluxes and ATP yield, leading to variation in biomass synthesis.},

FBA can characterize the metabolic behavior due to genetic deletions at the metabolic level, and the effect of mutations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle on mitochondrial ATP production was simulated. The mitochondrial ATP production is severely affected by TCA-cycle mutations. In addition, the model predicts the secretion of TCA-cycle intermediates, which is observed in clinical studies of mitochondriopathies such as those associated with fumarase deficiency.

The MsrA and MsrB families can reduce free MetO and MetO within a peptide or protein context. This process is stereospecific with the S- and R-forms of MetO repaired by MsrA and MsrB, respectively. Cell extracts from an MsrA(-)B(-) knockout of Escherichia coli have several remaining Msr activities. This study has identified an enzyme specific for the free form of Met-(R)-O, fRMsr, through proteomic analysis. The recombinant enzyme exhibits the same substrate specificity and is as active as MsrA family members. E. coli fRMsr is, however, 100- to 1,000-fold more active than non-selenocysteine-containing MsrB enzymes for free Met-(R)-O. The crystal structure of E. coli fRMsr was previously determined, but no known function was assigned. Thus, the function of this protein has now been determined. The structural similarity of the E. coli and yeast proteins suggests that most fRMsrs use three cysteine residues for catalysis and the formation of a disulfide bond to enclose a small active site cavity. This latter feature is most likely a key determinant of substrate specificity. Moreover, E. coli fRMsr is the first GAF domain family member to show enzymatic activity. Other GAF domain proteins substitute the Cys residues and others to specifically bind cyclic nucleotides, chromophores, and many other ligands for signal potentiation. Therefore, Met-(R)-O may represent a signaling molecule in response to oxidative stress and nutrients via the TOR pathway in some organisms.},

	abstract = {Rat liver and Trypanosoma cruzi tyrosine aminotransferases (TATs) share over 40\% sequence identity, but differ in their substrate specificities. To explore the molecular features related to these differences, comparative mutagenesis studies were conducted on full length T. cruzi TAT and N-terminally truncated rat TAT recombinant enzymes. The functionality of Arg315 and Arg417 in rat TAT was investigated for comparison with the conserved Arg292 and Arg386 in aspartate and bacterial aromatic aminotransferases (ASATs and ARATs). The rat TAT Arg315Lys variant remained fully active indicating that, as in T. cruzi TAT and contrary to subfamily Ialpha aminotransferases, this residue is not critical for activity. In contrast, the Arg417Gln variant was inactive. The catalytic relevance of the putative rat TAT active site residues Asn54 and Arg57, which are strictly conserved in TATs (Asn17 and Arg20 in T. cruzi TAT) but differ in ASATs and ARATs, was also explored. The substitutions Arg57Ala and Arg57Gln abolished enzymatic activity of these mutants. In both variants, spectral studies demonstrated that aromatic but not dicarboxylic substrates could efficiently bind in the active site. Thus, Arg57 appears to be functionally equivalent to Arg292 of ASATs and ARATs. Asn54 also appears to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of rat TAT since its exchange for Ser lowered the k(cat)/K(m) ratios towards its substrates. Mutation of the analogous residues in T. cruzi TAT also lowered the catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)) of the variants substantially. The results imply that the mamalian TAT is more closely related to the T. cruzi TAT than to ASATs and ARATs.},

	abstract = {Abstract  It is theoretically analysed whether the structural design of ATP-producing pathways, in particular the design of glycolysis,
may be explained by optimization principles. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic principles conclusions are derived
concerning the stoichiometry of these pathways in states of high ATP production rates. One of the extensions to previous investigations
is that the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides are taken into account as variable quantities. This necessitates the
consideration of an interaction of the ATP-producing system I with an external ATP-consuming system II. A great variety of
pathways is studied which differ in the number and location of ATP-consuming reactions, ATP-producing reactions and reactions
involving inorganic phosphate. The corresponding number of possible pathways may be calculated in an explicit manner as a
function of the number of those reactions which do not couple to ATP or inorganic phosphate. The kinetics of the individual
reactions are described by linear or bilinear functions of reactant concentrations and all rate equations are expressed in
terms of equilibrium constants and characteristic times. A thermodynamical analysis of the two coupled systems yields upper
and lower limits for the concentration of ATP and an explicit expression for the maximal difference between the number of
ATP-producing and ATP-consuming reactions of system I. The following results of the optimization are obtained. (i) The ATP
production rate always increases if the ATP-producing reactions as well as those reactions characterized by an uptake of inorganic
phosphate are shifted as far as possible towards the end of system I. (ii) Explicit conditions for the optimal location of
the ATP-consuming reactions are presented. The results are discussed in the context of characteristic times as well as in
terms of enzyme kinetic parameters. (iii) For two sets of characteristic times the resulting stoichiometries and their corresponding
steady-state fluxes are investigated in detail. One of these stoichiometries shows a close correspondence to contemporary
standard glycolysis. (iv) It is shown that most possible pathways result in a very low steady-state flux, that is, the optimal
stoichiometry is characterized by a significant selective advantage. (v) The standard free energy profile of a pathway with
an optimal stoichiometry is discussed. It differs significantly from the free energy profiles of nonoptimized pathways.},

The cofactors were assayed by using the very sensitive cycling assay described previously by Cartier. Control experiments showed that the level of total NAD(H) falls during harvesting, and so samples were taken quickly from growing cultures and extracted immediately without separating the cells from the medium. Total NAD(H) ranged from 4.0 to 11.7 \{micro\}moles/g of dry cells for three facultative organisms, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus albus. NADH was remarkably constant in these bacteria; only one out of ten series of determinations was outside the range 1.4 to 1.9 \{micro\}moles/g of dry cells. NAD+ showed much greater variation. An anaerobe (Clostridium welchii) had significantly more total NAD(H) whereas an aerobe Pseudomonas aeruginosa had about as much NAD(H) as the facultative organisms. NAD and NADH were measured during growth: once more NADH was much more constant than NAD. During change-over between aerobiosis and anaerobiosis, NADH showed a temporary increase but then returned to a constant level, whereas NAD changed from high aerobically to low anaerobically. These results are discussed in terms of the control mechanisms that may be involved.},

This metabolic flux ratio analysis by GC?MS provides a comprehensive perspective on central metabolism by quantifying 14 ratios of fluxes through converging pathways and reactions from [1?13C] and [U?13C]glucose experiments. Reliability and accuracy of this method were experimentally verified by successfully capturing expected flux responses of Escherichia coli to environmental modifications and seven knockout mutations in all major pathways of central metabolism. Furthermore, several mutants exhibited additional, unexpected flux responses that provide new insights into the behavior of the metabolic network in its entirety. Most prominently, the low in vivo activity of the Entner? Doudoroff pathway in wild?type E.?coli increased up to a contribution of 30\% to glucose catabolism in mutants of glycolysis and TCA cycle. Moreover, glucose 6?phosphate dehydrogenase mutants catabolized glucose not exclusively via glycolysis, suggesting a yet unidentified bypass of this reaction. Although strongly affected by environmental conditions, a stable balance between anaplerotic and TCA cycle flux was maintained by all mutants in the upper part of metabolism. Overall, our results provide quantitative insight into flux changes that bring about the resilience of metabolic networks to disruption.},

MPS can be used subsequently to aid the identification of appropriate genotypes or genetic modifications that will redirect metabolism towards amplified production of desirable bioproducts. Two examples illustrating the capabilities of MPS are presented. In the first example, which considers the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to pyruvate, MPS synthesized the classical catabolic pathways (EMP, pentose phosphate and ED) along with possible variations.

E. coli thus seems to use complementary strategies that result in a metabolic network robust against perturbations.

	abstract = {The active site of myo-inositol dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.18) from Bacillus subtilis recognizes a variety of mono- and disaccharides, as well as 1l-4-O-substituted inositol derivatives. It catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of the axial alcohol of these substrates with comparable kinetic constants. We have found that 4-O-p-toluenesulfonyl-myo-inositol does not act as a substrate for IDH, in contrast to structurally similar compounds such as those bearing substituted benzyl substituents in the same position. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 4-O-p-toluenesulfonyl-myo-inositol and 4-O-(2-naphthyl)methyl-myo-inositol, which is a substrate for IDH, shows a distinct difference in the preferred conformation of the aryl substituent. Conformational analysis of known substrates of IDH suggests that this conformational difference may account for the difference in reactivity of 4-O-p-toluenesulfonyl-myo-inositol in the presence of IDH. A sequence alignment of IDH with the homologous glucose-fructose oxidoreductase allowed the construction of an homology model of inositol dehydrogenase, to which NADH and 4-O-benzyl-scyllo-inosose were docked and the active site energy minimized. The active site model is consistent with all experimental results and suggests that a conserved tyrosine-glycine-tyrosine motif forms the hydrophobic pocket adjoining the site of inositol recognition. Y233F and Y235F retain activity, while Y233R and Y235R do not. A histidine-aspartate pair, H176 and D172, are proposed to act as a dyad in which H176 is the active site acid/base. The enzyme is inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate, and the mutants H176A and D172N show a marked loss of activity. Kinetic isotope effect experiments with D172N indicate that chemistry is rate-determining for this mutant.},

	abstract = {Elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with various human pathologies, including cardiovascular disease. However, it is not exactly known why Hcy is harmful. A plausible hypothesis is that the indirect incorporation of Hcy into protein, referred to as protein N-homocysteinylation, leads to cell damage. A translational pathway involves: 1) reversible S-nitrosylation of Hcy with nitric oxide produced by nitric oxide synthase; 2) aminoacylation of tRNAMet with S-nitroso-Hcy catalyzed by MetRS; and 3) transfer of S-nitroso-Hcy from S-nitroso-Hcy-tRNAMet into growing polypeptide chains at positions normally occupied by methionine. Subsequent transnitrosylation leaves Hcy in the protein chain. A post-translational pathway involves: 1) metabolic conversion of Hcy to thiolactone by methionyl-tRNAsynthetase (MetRS), and 2) acylation of protein lysine residues by Hcy thiolactone. The levels of Hcy thiolactone and N-homocysteinylated protein in human vascular endothelial cells depend on the ratio of Hcy/Met, levels of folic acid, and HDL, factors linked to cardiovascular disease. HDL-associated human serum Hcy thiolactonase/paraoxonase hydrolyzes thiolactone to Hcy, thereby minimizing protein N-homocysteinylation. Variations in Hcy thiolactonase may play an important role in Hcy-associated human cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the two-component regulatory ArcAB system functions as a major control system for the regulation of expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in both aerobic and anaerobic catabolic pathways. Previously, we have described the physiological response of wild-type E. coli to changes in oxygen availability through the complete range from anaerobiosis to full aerobiosis (S. Alexeeva, B. de Kort, G. Sawers, K. J. Hellingwerf, and M. J. Teixeira de Mattos, J. Bacteriol. 182:4934-4940, 2000, and S. Alexeeva, K. J. Hellingwerf, and M. J. Teixeira de Mattos, J. Bacteriol. 184:1402-1406, 2002). Here, we address the question of the contribution of the ArcAB-dependent transcriptional regulation to this response. Wild-type E. coli and a mutant lacking the ArcA regulator were grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at controlled levels of oxygen availability ranging from full aerobiosis to complete anaerobiosis. A flux analysis of the distribution of catabolic fluxes over parallel pathways was carried out, and the intracellular redox state (as reflected by the NADH/NAD ratio) was monitored for all steady states. Deletion of ArcA neither significantly altered the in vivo activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate formate lyase nor significantly affected catabolism under fully aerobic and fully anaerobic conditions. In contrast, profound effects of the absence of ArcA were seen under conditions of oxygen-restricted growth: increased respiration, an altered electron flux distribution over the cytochrome o- and d-terminal oxidases, and a significant change in the intracellular redox state were observed. Thus, the ArcA regulator was found to exert major control on flux distribution, and it is concluded that the ArcAB system should be considered a microaerobic redox regulator.},

Upon truncation of this C-terminal domain, subunits dissociate irreversibly. Here, the C-terminal domain of dimeric MetRS from Pyrococcus abyssi was isolated and studied. It displays nonspecific tRNA-binding properties and has a crystalline structure closely resembling that of Trbp111, a dimeric tRNA-binding protein found in many bacteria and archaea. The obtained 3D model was used to direct mutations against dimerization of Escherichia coli MetRS. Comparison of the resulting mutants to native and C-truncated MetRS shows that the presence of the appended C-domain improves tRNA(Met) binding affinity. However, dimer formation is required to evidence the gain in affinity.},

The results have been used to assess the regulatory role of various metabolites in .
Gluconeogenesis is associated with high phosphoenolpyruvate levels and low levels of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, in agreement with the proposed regulatory mechanisms for phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.
Isotopic experiments indicate that considerable gluconeogenesis occurs in succinate- or glycerol-grown cells after the addition of glucose, although the levels of glycolytic intermediates resemble those of glucose-grown cells, indicating that control gluconeogenesis is leaky.
The levels of adenosine triphosphate are lower in slowly growing cells, limited either by the availability of carbon (cells grown on acetate-NHCl) or by the availability of nitrogen (cells grown on glucose-glycine). These changes reflect primarily changes in the total adenine nucleotide pool, rather than major changes in the ratio of various adenine nucleotides.
Measurements of the level of metabolic intermediates in acetate-grown cells, before and after the addition of glucose, suggest that isocitrate lyase is controlled in vivo by metabolites other than phosphoenolpyruvate, and that both isocitrate lyase and isocitrate dehydrogenase play roles in regulating isocitrate utilization.},

	abstract = {Xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRTase) from Bacillus subtilis is a representative of the highly xanthine specific XPRTases found in Gram-positive bacteria. These XPRTases constitute a distinct subclass of 6-oxopurine PRTases, which deviate strongly from the major class of H(X)GPRTases with respect to sequence, PRPP binding motif, and oligomeric structure. They are more related with the PurR repressor of Gram-positive bacteria, the adenine PRTase, and orotate PRTase. The catalytic function and high specificity for xanthine of B. subtilis XPRTase were investigated by ligand binding studies and reaction kinetics as a function of pH with xanthine, hypoxanthine, and guanine as substrates. The crystal structure of the dimeric XPRTase-GMP complex was determined to 2.05 A resolution. In a sequential reaction mechanism XPRTase binds first PRPP, stabilizing its active dimeric form, and subsequently xanthine. The XPRTase is able also to react with guanine and hypoxanthine albeit at much lower (10(-)(4)-fold) catalytic efficiency. Different pK(a) values for the bases and variations in their electrostatic potential can account for these catalytic differences. The unique base specificity of XPRTase has been related to a few key residues in the active site. Asn27 can in different orientations form hydrogen bonds to an amino group or an oxo group at the 2-position of the purine base, and Lys156 is positioned to make a hydrogen bond with N7. This and the absence of a catalytic carboxylate group near the N7-position require the purine base to dissociate a proton spontaneously in order to undergo catalysis.},

	title = {The principle of flux minimization and its application to estimate stationary fluxes in metabolic networks},
	volume = {271},
	abstract = {Cellular functions are ultimately linked to metabolic fluxes brought about by thousands of chemical reactions and transport processes. The synthesis of the underlying enzymes and membrane transporters causes the cell a certain 'effort' of energy and external resources. Considering that those cells should have had a selection advantage during natural evolution that enabled them to fulfil vital functions (such as growth, defence against toxic compounds, repair of DNA alterations, etc.) with minimal effort, one may postulate the principle of flux minimization, as follows: given the available external substrates and given a set of functionally important 'target' fluxes required to accomplish a specific pattern of cellular functions, the stationary metabolic fluxes have to become a minimum. To convert this principle into a mathematical method enabling the prediction of stationary metabolic fluxes, the total flux in the network is measured by a weighted linear combination of all individual fluxes whereby the thermodynamic equilibrium constants are used as weighting factors, i.e. the more the thermodynamic equilibrium lies on the right-hand side of the reaction, the larger the weighting factor for the backward reaction. A linear programming technique is applied to minimize the total flux at fixed values of the target fluxes and under the constraint of flux balance (= steady-state conditions) with respect to all metabolites. The theoretical concept is applied to two metabolic schemes: the energy and redox metabolism of erythrocytes, and the central metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The flux rates predicted by the flux-minimization method exhibit significant correlations with flux rates obtained by either kinetic modelling or direct experimental determination. Larger deviations occur for segments of the network composed of redundant branches where the flux-minimization method always attributes the total flux to the thermodynamically most favourable branch. Nevertheless, compared with existing methods of structural modelling, the principle of flux minimization appears to be a promising theoretical approach to assess stationary flux rates in metabolic systems in cases where a detailed kinetic model is not yet available.},

	abstract = {A gene (PP2216) that codes for an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was cloned from Pseudomonas putida strain KT2240 and over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme purified and characterised. The enzyme is tetrameric with one FAD per subunit of molecular mass 40,500 Da. An anaerobic titration with sodium dithionite showed that the enzyme accepts two electrons. A similar titration with butyryl-CoA showed that reduction by this substrate was incomplete with 4.5 mol butyryl-CoA added per mol enzyme FAD; the equilibrium was used to calculate that the oxidation-reduction potential of the enzyme at pH 7 and 25 degrees C is 5+/-5 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode. The enzyme shows catalytic activity with butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA, and very low activity with heptanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA; it fails to oxidise propionyl-CoA. These properties resemble those of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases from other sources. The enzyme is inactive with the CoA derivatives of all phenylalkanoates that were tested (side chains 3-8 carbon atoms) indicating that in contrast to an earlier suggestion, the enzyme is not involved in the beta-oxidation of aromatic compounds.},

	abstract = {We have analyzed, by site-directed mutagenesis, the molecular basis of the editing function and its relation to the synthetic function of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The data obtained fit a model of the active site that partitions an amino acid substrate between synthetic and editing pathways. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions direct the cognate substrate methionine through the synthetic pathway and prevent it from entering the editing pathway. Two hydrophobic interactions are proposed: between the side chain of Trp-305 and a methyl group of methionine and between the benzene ring of Tyr-15 and the beta- and gamma-CH2 groups of the substrate. An essential hydrogen bond forms between the OH of Tyr-15 and an electron pair of the sulfur atom of methionine. Consistent with these functions, side chains of Trp-305 and Tyr-15 are localized on opposite sides of the cavity forming a putative methionine binding pocket that is observed in the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Enzymes W305A, Y15A, and Y15F have diminished ability to discriminate against homocysteine in the synthetic reaction, compared to the wild-type enzyme. At the same time, mutant enzymes have lost the ability to discriminate against methionine in the editing reaction and edited Met-AMP to a similar extent as Hcy-AMP. Interactions of residues Arg-233 and Asp-52 of methionyl-tRNA synthetase with the carboxyl and amino groups, respectively, of the substrate, which are essential for the synthetic function, were also essential for the editing function of the enzyme. Deacylation of Met-tRNA to S-methylhomocysteine thiolactone catalyzed by W305A, Y15A, and Y15F mutant enzymes was only slightly impaired relative to the wild-type enzyme. However, enzymes R233Q, R233A, and D52A did not deacylate Met-tRNA. The model also explains why the noncognate homocysteine is edited by methionyl-tRNA synthetase.},

In this work, thermodynamic constraints on non-equilibrium metabolite concentrations are used to reveal the biochemical interactions between the metabolic pathways of ethanol and acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol), two drugs known to interact unfavorably. It is known that many reactions of these pathways are coupled to the central energy metabolic reactions through a number of metabolites and the cellular redox potential. Based on these observations, a metabolic network model has been constructed and a database of thermodynamic properties for all participating metabolites and reactions has been compiled. Constraint-based computational analysis of the feasible metabolite concentrations reveals that the non-toxic pathways for APAP metabolism and the pathway for detoxifying N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) are inhibited by network interactions with ethanol metabolism. These results point to the potential utility of thermodynamically based profiling of metabolic network interactions in screening of drug candidates and analysis of potential toxicity.},

The power of these approaches lies in the fact that the constraints are based on physical laws, and do not make use of unknown parameters. Here, we show that the network structure (i.e. the stoichiometric matrix) alone provides a system of constraints on the fluxes in a biochemical network which are feasible according to both mass balance and the laws of thermodynamics. A realistic example shows that these constraints can be sufficient for deriving unambiguous, biologically meaningful results. The thermodynamic constraints are obtained by comparing of the sign pattern of the flux vector to the sign patterns of the cycles of the internal cycle space via connection between stoichiometric network theory (SNT) and the mathematical theory of oriented matroids.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is a homodimeric enzyme. A model for its ability to recognize tRNA(Trp) in B. subtilis was proposed by using computer modelling. This was based on the the fact that there is high homology among bacterial TrpRSs [Chen, Jiang, Jin and Wang (2001) Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica 33, 687-690], in which the enzyme dimer binds to two tRNA(Trp) molecules and each tRNA(Trp) is bound to two different domains across the surface of the dimer. In this work, three deletion mutants of TrpRS were constructed and their products were purified. After determining the kinetic parameters of the mutants in the two-step reaction, it was found that the relative activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes had changed little in the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction. In contrast, the activities of three mutant proteins were much decreased in the tRNA(Trp) aminoacylation assay. Deletion of residues 108-122 and residues 234-238 caused 44\% and 80\% reductions in the activity, respectively. When both regions were deleted, the aminoacylation activity of the TrpRS mutant was too low to be determined using tRNA(Trp) at the limiting concentration. Gel-retardation assays showed that the acceptor minihelix and the anticodon microhelix were recognized by the domains of TrpRS spanning residues 108-122 and residues 234-238 respectively. In addition, the deletion of amino acids 234-238 affected the normal induced expression of TrpRS at 37 degrees C. In conclusion, residues 108-122 and 234-238 were found essential for tRNA(Trp) recognition.},

The large subunit of Rubisco is encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene, which is widely used for reconstruction of plant phylogenies due to its conservative nature. Plant systematicists have mainly used rbcL paying little attention to its function, and the question whether it evolves under Darwinian selection has received little attention. The purpose of our study was to evaluate how common is positive selection in Rubisco among the phototrophs and where in the Rubisco structure does positive selection occur.RESULTS:We searched for positive selection in rbcL sequences from over 3000 species representing all lineages of green plants and some lineages of other phototrophs, such as brown and red algae, diatoms, euglenids and cyanobacteria. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis found the presence of positive selection in rbcL of most analyzed land plants, but not in algae and cyanobacteria. The mapping of the positively selected residues on the Rubisco tertiary structure revealed that they are located in regions important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase interactions, and that some of the positively selected residues are close to the active site.CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that despite its conservative nature, Rubisco evolves under positive selection in most lineages of land plants, and after billions of years of evolution Darwinian selection still fine-tunes its performance. Widespread positive selection in rbcL has to be taken into account when this gene is used for phylogenetic reconstructions.},

	abstract = {The non-protein amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), owing to its structural similarity to the protein amino acids methionine, isoleucine, and leucine, enters first steps of protein synthesis and is activated by methionyl-, isoleucyl-, and leucyl-tRNA synthetases in vivo. However, translational incorporation of Hcy into protein is prevented by editing mechanisms of these synthetases, which convert misactivated Hcy into thiolactone. The lack of efficient interactions of the side chain of Hcy with the specificity subsite of the synthetic/editing active site is a prerequisite for editing of Hcy. Thus, if the side chain thiol of Hcy were reversibly modified with a small molecule that would enhance its binding to the specificity subsite and prevent editing, such modified Hcy is predicted to be transferred to tRNA and incorporated translationally into protein. Here I show that S-nitroso-Hcy is in fact transferred to tRNA by methionyl-tRNA synthetase and incorporated into protein by the bacterium Escherichia coli. S-Nitroso-Hcy-tRNA also supports translation of mRNAs in a rabbit reticulocyte system. Removal of the nitroso group yields Hcy-tRNA and protein containing Hcy in peptide bonds. S-Nitrosylation-mediated translational incorporation of Hcy into protein may occur under natural conditions in cells and contribute to Hcy-induced pathogenesis in atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {The design of metabolic pathways is thought to be the result of an optimization process such that the structure of contemporary metabolic routes maximizes a particular objective function. Recently, it has been shown that some essential stoichiometric properties of glycolysis can be explained on the basis of the requirement for a high ATP production rate. Because the number of stoichiometrically feasible designs increases strongly with the number of reactions involved, a systematic analysis of all the possibilities turns out to be inaccessible beyond a certain system size. We present, therefore, an alternative approach to compute in a more efficient way the optimal design of glycolysis interacting with an external ATP-consuming reaction. The algorithm is based on the laws of evolution by natural selection, and may be viewed as a particular version of evolutionary algorithms. The following conclusions are derived: (a) evolutionary algorithms are very useful search strategies in determining optimal stoichiometries of metabolic pathways. (b) Essential topological features of the glycolytic network may be explained on the basis of flux optimization. (c) There is a strong interrelation between the optimal stoichiometries and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the participating reactions. (d) Some subsequences of reactions in optimal pathways are strongly conserved at variation of system parameters, which may be understood by applying principles of metabolic control analysis.},

In this second part, we present a chemical analysis of the glycolytic pathway in order to determine if its design is chemically optimized according the possibilities that a glycolytic design can have. Our results demonstrate that glycolysis in modern-day cells (from glucose to lactate) has an optimized design for maximizing the flux of ATP production, and a thermodynamic profile which guarantees a high kinetic efficiency. We also discuss some cases of paleometabolism for this pathway as alternative metabolic pathways, less optimized, that exist in some bacteria. Our analysis relates mainly to metabolism designed under constant chemical affinity (substrates and products of the pathway constant), where the target of optimization can be the flux of ATP production. We also discuss the case of an externally imposed input flux, whose target of optimization is the stoichiometric yield of ATP.},

	abstract = {The D1 protein subunit of the photochemical reaction center II (RCII) turns over rapidly in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms exposed to the light. At high photon flux densities (PFD), photoinactivation of RCII precedes the degradation of the D1 protein. We found that the apparent quantum yield for the D1 protein degradation in cells is severalfold higher at low PFDs (10-100 μmol m s) as compared to that observed at PFDs which induce photoinactivation of RCII (1.5-3 × 10 μmol m s). Relative high levels of reduced RCII secondary plastoquinone acceptor, Q, are induced in cells exposed to low PFDs as determined by thermoluminescence measurements. The probability of generating elevated levels of Q which may recombine with the S oxidized states of the oxygen evolving complex decreases with increase in the light intensities at which consecutive double reduction of Q and exchange with the plastoquinone pool prevail. We have used light flashes to test if a correlation exists between the degradation of D1 protein and the relative level of Q. D1 protein degradation could be induced in dark-incubated cells exposed to a series of 1.4 × 10 single light flashes given at intervals compatible with generation of elevated levels of Q and its decay by charge recombination. Oscillations of the Q level in cells exposed to 960-1440 series of 1 to several flashes correlated with oscillations of the D1 protein degradation in cells and in the wild type but not in the LF-1 mutant lacking photosystem II donor side activity. In this mutant the “S state cycle” and Q oscillations are abolished. We propose that the process of recombination of long lived RCII-Q with the S states may involve damaging events related to the D1 protein degradation induced by light flashes or continuous low light},

	abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In order to gain information about other possible sites of contact between MetRS and its tRNA substrates, we have examined the effects of mutations at a series of positively charged residues on the surface of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. Conversion of Arg356, Arg366, Arg380, or Arg453 to Gln had little or no effect on enzyme activity. Similarly, conversion of Lys402 or Lys439 to Asn failed to significantly alter aminoacylation activity. Conversion of Arg380 to Ala or Arg442 to Gln produced a 5-fold reduction in kcat/Km for aminoacylation of tRNAfMet, with no effect on methionine activation, indicating a possible minor role for these residues in interaction of the enzyme with the tRNA substrate. In contrast, mutation of a phylogenetically conserved residue, Arg395, to Gln increased the Km for aminoacylation of tRNAfMet about 30-fold and reduced kcat/Km by 25,000-fold. The mutant enzyme was also shown to be highly defective by its inability to complement a strain of E. coli having an altered chromosomal MetRS gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required for the production of cell material from the different carbon sources was calculated on the basis of known ATP requirements in the biochemical pathways and routes of macromolecular synthesis. The calculated ATP requirements, together with the measured growth rates and growth yields on the different carbon sources, were used to calculate the rate of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. This rate was closely related to the respiration rate.

The enzyme displayed a temperature optimum between 25 and 30 degrees C, and an optimum pH range of 6-8 for the oxidation of beta-d-glucose. The enzyme was stable at 25 degrees C for a minimum of 10h, with a half-life of approximately 30 min at 37 degrees C without any prior stabilisation. The lyophilized enzyme was stable at -20 degrees C for a minimum of 6 months. GOX from Penicillium sp.

	abstract = {The field experiment was executed with peanut cv. Fenghua No. 1 from 2004 to 2005 in the experimental station of Shandong Agricultural University to study the effects of N, P, K fertilizers application amount on physiological characteristics, yield and kernel quality of peanut. The results showed that, compared with no fertilization, application N, P, K fertilizers increased the content of chlorophyll and soluble protein, enhanced photosynthetic rate and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catlase (CAT), and reduced malondialdeyde (MDA) accumulation amount in peanut leaves. The effects of applying N 300-450 kg x hm(-2), P5O2, 150-225 kg x hm(-2) and K2O 300-450 kg x hm(-2) treatments were the most significant. The improvement effect of N fertilizer on photosynthesis properties was mainly at early stage, and that of P was at middle-later stage, K was at whole stage. Applying N, P, K fertilizers increased the pod yield of peanut remarkably, and with the increasing of N application amount the pod yield enhanced, the pod yields were highest when P and K application were at middle amount rates (P5O2, 150 kg x hm(-2) K2O 300 kg x hm(-2)). The increasing effect on pod yield of K fertilizer was greater than that of N and P fertilizers. Applying a small amount of P and K fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg x hm(-2), K2O 150 kg x hm(-2)) could significantly increase the contents of fat and protein in peanut kernel, applying a small amount of N fertilizer (N 150 kg x hm(-2)) could significantly increase the content of protein in peanut kernel, but applying a large amount of N fertilizer (N 450 kg x hm(-2)) could significantly increase the content of fat in peanut kernel. Applying P fertilizer obviously increased fat and protein content, applying N fertilizer mainly enhanced protein content, and applying K fertilizer mainly raised the content of soluble sugar. In addition, the application of N, P and K fertilizers also increased the contents of lysine and methionine which were inadequate in the protein fractions of peanut kernel, enhanced the contents of oleic acid and linoleic acid, raised the ratio of oleic acid to linoleic acid, improved nutritional quality of peanut, and pronged the shelf life of peanut products.},

From the mid-Mesozoic, coccolithophores have been major calcium carbonate producers in the world's oceans, today accounting for about a third of the total marine CaCO3 production. Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi are significantly increased by high CO2 partial pressures. Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40\% increase in average coccolith mass. Our findings show that coccolithophores are already responding and will probably continue to respond to rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressures, which has important implications for biogeochemical modeling of future oceans and climate.},

In addition, KEGG provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to the environment, such as for the analysis of drug-target relationships, through the process of BRITE mapping. KEGG BRITE is an ontology database representing functional hierarchies of various biological objects, including molecules, cells, organisms, diseases and drugs, as well as relationships among them. KEGG PATHWAY is now supplemented with a new global map of metabolic pathways, which is essentially a combined map of about 120 existing pathway maps. In addition, smaller pathway modules are defined and stored in KEGG MODULE that also contains other functional units and complexes. The KEGG resource is being expanded to suit the needs for practical applications. KEGG DRUG contains all approved drugs in the US and Japan, and KEGG DISEASE is a new database linking disease genes, pathways, drugs and diagnostic markers.},

	abstract = {The Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) produces the well-known and remarkably complex anti-cancer dimeric alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine that are derived from the coupling of vindoline and catharanthine monomers. This study describes the novel application of a carborundum abrasion (CA) technique for large-scale isolation of leaf epidermis-enriched proteins in order to purify to apparent homogeneity 16-hydroxytabersonine-16-O-methyltransferase (16OMT), which catalyses the second of six steps in the conversion of tabersonine into vindoline, and to clone the gene. Functional expression and biochemical characterization of recombinant 16OMT demonstrated its very narrow substrate specificity and high affinity for 16-hydroxytabersonine. In addition to allowing the cloning of this gene, the CA technique clearly showed that 16OMT is predominantly expressed in Catharanthus leaf epidermis. The results provide compelling evidence that most of the pathway for vindoline biosynthesis, including the O-methylation of 16-hydroxytabersonine, occurs exclusively in the leaf epidermis, with subsequent steps occurring in other leaf cell types.},

	abstract = {Native liver glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is N-acetylated while the recombinant enzyme is not. We show here that acetylation of the N-terminal valine affects several kinetic parameters of the enzyme. Glycine N-methyltransferase is a regulatory enzyme mediating the availability of methyl groups by virtue of being inhibited by folate. N-acetylation does not affect the overall structure of the protein and does not affect basal enzyme activity of GNMT. Binding of both the mono- and pentaglutamate forms of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is the same for the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of the enzyme, however the pentaglutamate form is bound more tightly than the monoglutamate form in both cases. Although binding of the folates is similar for the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of the enzyme, inhibition of enzyme activity differs significantly. The native, N-acetylated form of the enzyme shows 50\% inhibition at 1.3 microM concentration of the pentaglutamate while the recombinant non-acetylated form shows 50\% inhibition at 590 microM. In addition, the binding of folate results in cooperativity of the substrate S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), with a Hill coefficient of 1.5 for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate.},

However, for reasons of efficiency, cheminformatics toolkits such as the OpenBabel toolkit are often implemented in compiled languages such as C++. We describe Pybel, a Python module that provides access to the OpenBabel toolkit.RESULTS:Pybel wraps the direct toolkit bindings to simplify common tasks such as reading and writing molecular files and calculating fingerprints. Extensive use is made of Python iterators to simplify loops such as that over all the molecules in a file. A Pybel Molecule can be easily interconverted to an OpenBabel OBMol to access those methods or attributes not wrapped by Pybel.CONCLUSION:Pybel allows cheminformaticians to rapidly develop Python scripts that manipulate chemical information. It is open source, available cross-platform, and offers the power of the OpenBabel toolkit to Python programmers.},

In this RC, the special pair (P) and accessory (B) bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) -binding sites contain Zn-BChl rather than BChl . Spectroscopic measurements reveal that Zn-BChl also occupies the H sites that are normally occupied by bacteriopheophytin in wild type, and at least 1 of these Zn-BChl molecules is involved in electron transfer in intact Zn-RCs with an efficiency of {\textgreater}95\% of the wild-type RC. The absorption spectrum of this Zn-containing RC in the near-infrared region associated with P and B is shifted from 865 to 855 nm and from 802 to 794 nm respectively, compared with wild type. The bands of P and B in the visible region are centered at 600 nm, similar to those of wild type, whereas the H-cofactors have a band at 560 nm, which is a spectral signature of monomeric Zn-BChl in organic solvent. The Zn-BChl H-cofactor spectral differences compared with the P and B positions in the visible region are proposed to be due to a difference in the 5th ligand coordinating the Zn. We suggest that this coordination is a key feature of protein–cofactor interactions, which significantly contributes to the redox midpoint potential of H and the formation of the charge-separated state, and provides a unifying explanation for the properties of the primary acceptor in photosystems I (PS1) and II (PS2).},

Open‐reading frame coding regions were replaced with a kanamycin cassette flanked by FLP recognition target sites by using a one‐step method for inactivation of chromosomal genes and primers designed to create in‐frame deletions upon excision of the resistance cassette. Of 4288 genes targeted, mutants were obtained for 3985. To alleviate problems encountered in high‐throughput studies, two independent mutants were saved for every deleted gene. These mutants—the ‘Keio collection’—provide a new resource not only for systematic analyses of unknown gene functions and gene regulatory networks but also for genome‐wide testing of mutational effects in a common strain background, E. coli K‐12 BW25113. We were unable to disrupt 303 genes, including 37 of unknown function, which are candidates for essential genes. Distribution is being handled via GenoBase (http://ecoli.aist‐nara.ac.jp/).
Visual Overview
SynopsisThe long‐term goal of biomedical research has always been the complete understanding of biological systems. In the last century, reductionist approaches proved immensely powerful in elucidating many biochemical, genetic, and molecular mechanisms. In this century, we are entering a more synthetic phase in which we will accomplish the goal of completely understanding biological systems in their incredible living complexity. This understanding will be expressed in a number of models, ranging from traditional biological understanding (where individuals construct models in their heads) to formal mathematical models. In any case, reaching a complete understanding requires an unprecedented standardization and completeness of data, greatly improved methods of accessing and linking information, and improved techniques and approaches for mathematical modeling.E. coli K‐12 is the best‐characterized organism at the molecular level. In the accompanying report, we describe its highly accurate sequence (Hayashi et al, 2006), perhaps more accurate than of any genome of similar size, maybe even error free. Determination of a highly accurate sequence provided the impetus for re‐annotation of its genome (Riley et al, 2006), which is of fundamental importance to studies not only of E. coli biology but also of other organisms because properties of more than half of its gene products have been experimentally determined.More than a half‐century of experimental investigation has led to the identification of nearly all the metabolic reactions and the small molecule metabolites involved therein. Many of the regulatory circuits have been identified and computational methods for the predication of many regulatory sites are available. It is thus a truism that ‘… all cell biologists have two cells of interest, the one they are studying and Escherichia coli’ (Neidhardt, 1996). E. coli has the further advantage of being a simple unicellular organism without as extensive an elaboration of compartments and transport mechanisms as are present even in simple eukaryotes such as yeast (Figure 7, Holden, 2002). The completeness of our knowledge and the relative simplicity of E. coli provide compelling reasons for choosing it as the first cellular system to be targeted for complete understanding. This was clearly seen by Francis Crick when in 1973 (Crick, 1973) he proposed ‘Project K: the complete solution of E. coli.’ Of course, his suggestion was hopelessly premature, being before many key technologies, rapid computation, and the web (Crick, 2002).With a goal towards complete understanding of E. coli as a simple cellular system, we have begun the construction of uniformly designed and comprehensively prepared resources. Here, we describe a complete set of precisely defined, single‐gene deletions of nonessential E. coli K‐12 genes. These mutants were constructed by using a PCR gene replacement method similar to the one used to create a nearly complete set of yeast gene mutants (Giaever et al, 2002), except by using E. coli cells carrying a plasmid expressing the highly efficient λ Red recombinase (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000) (Figure 8).Deletions were obtained for 3985 of 4288 targeted genes. Based on finding mutants with the predicted structures, the majority of these 3985 genes are probably nonessential. Because a small fraction (ca. 0.2\%) of cells are predicted to contain genetic duplications (Anderson and Roth, 1977), a small number of these 3985 genes may in fact be essential. The majority of the 303 genes for which no mutants were obtained are candidates for essential genes, at least under our selection conditions (aerobic growth on a complex medium at 37°C).In bacteria, genes are often arranged in operons that are transcribed as a unit and in which neighboring genes frequently overlap a few to several nucleotides. In such arrangements, mutation of a single gene can simultaneously affect function of neighboring or downstream genes. To circumvent these kinds of problems, mutants were designed taking into account gene organization to avoid affecting properties of more than one gene simultaneously. All mutants contain a kanamycin resistance cassette in place of the gene coding region. In most cases, the coding region from the 2nd through the 7th codon from the C‐terminus has been deleted. The kanamycin resistance gene is oriented for expression of downstream genes (Figure 8A). Further, the mutants were constructed by use of a resistance cassette that can be easily eliminated (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). The resultant kanamycin‐sensitive derivatives are predicted to encode a small in‐frame peptide in place of the mutated gene, in order to reduce effects on expression of downstream genes (Figure 8B).Results of profiling the mutants for growth on synthetic and rich media are described in the manuscript. These mutants provide a new basic resource not only for systematic functional genomics studies but also experimental data source for systems biology approaches. By providing this resource openly to the research community, the authors hope to contribute to worldwide efforts directed towards a comprehensive understanding of the E. coli K‐12 model cell. Accordingly, we are making the entire mutant collection freely available for nonprofit, noncommercial use via GenoBase (http://ecoli.aist‐nara.ac.jp) for cost of duplication and shipping fees. Commercial and for‐profit investigators should contact one of the corresponding authors directly.
A complete set of single‐gene deletions of all non‐essential genes has been created in E. coli K‐12 by replacing coding regions with a kanamycin resistance cassette.Deletions were designed to create in‐frame, non‐polar mutations upon eviction of the resistance cassette by use of the FLP recombinase.These mutants called the Keio collection provide a new resource for genome‐wide functional genomics of the E. coli model cell and whole cell modeling.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to review in how far thermodynamic analysis can be used to understand and predict the performance of microorganisms with respect to growth and bioproduct synthesis. In the first part, a simple thermodynamic model of microbial growth is developed which explains the relationship between the driving force for growth in terms of Gibbs energy dissipation and biomass yield. From the currently available literature, it appears that the Gibbs energy dissipation per C-mol of biomass grown, which represents the driving force for chemotrophic growth, may have been adapted by evolutionary processes to strike a reasonable compromise between metabolic rate and growth efficiency. Based on empirical correlations of the C-molar Gibbs energy dissipation, the wide variety of biomass yields observed in nature can be explained and roughly predicted. This type of analysis may be highly useful in environmental applications, where such wide variations occur. It is however not able to predict biomass yields in very complex systems such as mammalian cells nor is it able to predict or to assess bioproduct or recombinant protein yields. For this purpose, a much more sophisticated treatment that accounts for individual metabolic pathways separately is required. Based on glycolysis as a test example, it is shown in the last part that simple thermodynamic analysis leads to erroneous conclusions even in well-known, simple cases. Potential sources for errors have been analyzed and can be used to identify the most important needs for future research.},

	abstract = {The driving force for organo- or lithotrophic growth as well as for each step in the metabolic network is the Gibbs reaction energy. For each enzymatic step it must be negative. Thermodynamics contributes therefore to the in-silico description of living systems. It may be used for assessing the feasibility of a given pathway because it provides a further constraint for those pathways which are feasible from the point of view of mass balance calculations (metabolic flux analysis) and the genetic potential of an organism. However, when this constraint was applied to lactic acid fermentation according to a method proposed by Mavrovouniotis (1993a, ISMB 93:273–283) it turned out that an unrealistically wide metabolite concentration range had to be assumed to make this well-known glycolytic pathway thermodynamically feasible. During a search for the reasons of this surprising result the insufficient consideration of the activity coefficients was identified as main cause. However, it is shown in the present contribution that the influence of the activity coefficients on Gibbs reaction energy can be easily taken into account based on the intracellular ionic strength. The uncertainty of the tabulated equilibrium constants and of the apparent standard Gibbs energies derived from them was found to be the second most important reason for the erroneous result of the feasibility analysis. Deviations of intracellular pH from the standard value and bad estimations of currency metabolites, e.g., NAD+ and NADH, were found to be of lesser importance but not negligible. The pH dependency of Gibbs reaction enthalpy was proved to be easily taken into account. Therefore, the application of thermodynamics for a better in-silico prediction of the behavior of living cell factories calls predominantly for better equilibrium data determined under well defined conditions and also for a more detailed knowledge about the intracellular ionic strength and pH value. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic feasibility analysis (TFA) has been used as a tool capable of providing additional constraints to the mass balance-based methods of analysis of metabolic networks (e.g., flux balance analysis). Several publications have recently appeared in which TFA of different metabolic pathways from relatively simple to the genome-scale networks was described as a means of detecting the possible metabolic control steps. However, in order to perform TFA, many simplifying assumptions were necessary. On the other hand, it has been shown by applying TFA to the well-known pathway of glycolysis that erroneous simplifying assumptions may seriously bias the results of the analysis. A quantitative analysis of the influence of non-ideality of the biochemical system, pH, temperature, and complexation of the metabolites with Mg2+ ions as well as a number of other factors on the TFA is reported. It is shown that the feasibility of glycolysis is very seriously limited by the reaction of oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde phosphate, and that the intracellular concentration of the main product of this reaction, biphosphoglycerate, must be anywhere from 10 to 100 times lower than published values. In addition, the driving force for this reaction, and consequently the feasibility of the entire pathway depend strongly on the intracellular pH and ionic strength and to a lesser extent on pMg and temperature. The analysis may also be influenced by uncertainties of the dissociation and magnesium complexation constants of glyceraldehyde phosphate. The analysis demonstrates the crucial importance of taking such factors into account when performing TFA. It also suggests an urgent need for experimental determinations of such factors as a prerequisite for sensible thermodynamic analysis of metabolism on a genome-wide scale. Biotechnol.

	abstract = {We present a simple method for estimating kinetic parameters from progress curve analysis of biologically catalyzed reactions that reduce to forms analogous to the Michaelis–Menten equation. Specifically, the Lambert W function is used to obtain explicit, closed-form solutions to differential rate expressions that describe the dynamics of substrate depletion. The explicit nature of the new solutions greatly simplifies nonlinear estimation of the kinetic parameters since numerical techniques such as the Runge–Kutta and Newton–Raphson methods used to solve the differential and integral forms of the kinetic equations, respectively, are replaced with a simple algebraic expression. The applicability of this approach for estimating Vmax and Km in the Michaelis–Menten equation was verified using a combination of simulated and experimental progress curve data. For simulated data, final estimates of Vmax and Km were close to the actual values of 1 AM/h and 1 AM, respectively, while the standard errors for these parameter estimates were proportional to the error level in the simulated data sets. The method was also applied to hydrogen depletion experiments by mixed cultures of bacteria in activated sludge resulting in Vmax and Km estimates of 6.531 AM/h and 2.136 AM, respectively. The algebraic nature of this solution, coupled with its relatively high accuracy, makes it an attractive candidate for kinetic parameter estimation from progress curve data.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

Therefore, this experimental metabolomics methodology may allow the tracing of metabolic pathways starting from stable-isotope-enriched precursors, which can improve our mechanistic understanding of cellular metabolism. However, contributions to the observed intensities arising from the stable isotope's natural abundance must be subtracted (deisotoped) from the raw isotopologue peaks before interpretation. Previously posed deisotoping problems are sidestepped due to the isotopic resolution and identification of individual isotopologue peaks. This peak resolution and identification come from the very high mass resolution and accuracy of FT-ICR-MS and present an analytically solvable deisotoping problem, even in the context of stable-isotope enrichment.},

	abstract = {Background: The optimization of metabolic rates (as linear objective functions) represents the methodical core of flux-balance analysis techniques which have become a standard tool for the study of genome-scale metabolic models. Besides (growth and synthesis) rates, metabolic yields are key parameters for the characterization of biochemical transformation processes, especially in the context of biotechnological applications. However, yields are ratios of rates, and hence the optimization of yields (as nonlinear objective functions) under arbitrary linear constraints is not possible with current flux-balance analysis techniques. Despite the fundamental importance of yields in constraint-based modeling, a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization is still missing. Results: We present a mathematical theory that allows one to systematically compute and analyze yield-optimal solutions of metabolic models under arbitrary linear constraints. In particular, we formulate yield optimization as a linear-fractional program. For practical computations, we transform the linear-fractional yield optimization problem to a (higher-dimensional) linear problem. Its solutions determine the solutions of the original problem and can be used to predict yield-optimal flux distributions in genome-scale metabolic models. For the theoretical analysis, we consider the linear-fractional problem directly. Most importantly, we show that the yield-optimal solution set (like the rate-optimal solution set) is determined by (yield-optimal) elementary flux vectors of the underlying metabolic model. However, yield- and rate-optimal solutions may differ from each other, and hence optimal (biomass or product) yields are not necessarily obtained at solutions with optimal (growth or synthesis) rates. Moreover, we discuss phase planes/production envelopes and yield spaces, in particular, we prove that yield spaces are convex and provide algorithms for their computation. We illustrate our findings by a small example and demonstrate their relevance for metabolic engineering with realistic models of E. coli. Conclusions: We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization in metabolic models. Our theory is particularly useful for the study and rational modification of cell factories designed under given yield and/or rate requirements.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of biochemical pathways satisfying stoichiometric constraints is discussed. Stoichiometric constraints arise primarily from designating compounds as required or allowed reactants, and required or allowed products of the pathways; they also arise from similar restrictions on intermediate metabolites and bioreactions participating in the pathways. An algorithm for the complete and correct solution of the problem is presented; the algorithm satisfies each constraint by recursively transforming a base-set of pathways. The algorithm is applied to the problem of lysine synthesis from glucose and ammonia. In addition to the established synthesis routes, the algorithm constructs several alternative pathways that bypass key enzymes, such as malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Apart from the construction of pathways with desired characteristics, the systematic synthesis of pathways can also uncover fundamental constraints in a particular problem, by demonstrating that no pathways exist to meet certain sets of specifications. In the case of lysine, the algorithm shows that oxaloacetate is a necessary intermediate in all pathways leading to lysine from glucose, and that the yield of lysine over glucose cannot exceed 67\% in the absence of enzymatic recovery of carbon dioxide.},

The obstructing pathway-segment may either be a single reaction (localized bottleneck) or a sequence of reactions (distributed bottleneck) which cannot take place simultaneously. We present a duality theory that converts the primal problem of selecting concentrations of species to make a pathway feasible to its dual problem of selecting linear combinations of reactions that make the pathway infeasible. The dual problem leads to an algorithm that can determine the thermodynamic feasibility of any chemical reaction system. The method involves the analysis of individual reactions and the selective construction of larger subpathways; it uncovers localized and distributed thermodynamic bottlenecks of a pathway.

The protein content of diets for adults can be based on the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 0.80 g/kg per day. Alternatively, the most recent Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for macronutrients reflect expanded guidance for assessing protein needs and consider the relative relation of absolute amounts of protein, carbohydrate, and fat to total energy intake in the context of chronic disease prevention. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) reflects the interrelation between the macronutrients and affords dietitians and clinicians additional flexibility in diet planning. Accounting for the caloric value of RDAs for carbohydrate and fat, “flexible calories” emerge as an opportunity to create varied eating plans that provide for protein intakes in excess of the RDA but within the AMDR. Protein Summit 2.0 highlighted the growing body of scientific evidence documenting the benefits of higher protein intakes at amounts approximating twice the RDA, which include promotion of healthy body weight and preservation of lean body mass and functional ability with age. The essential amino acid (EAA) density of a food also emerged as a novel concept analogous to “nutrient density,” which can enable the practitioner to calculate the caloric cost associated with a specific protein source to attain the daily requirement of EAAs to accomplish various health outcomes because these indispensable nutrients have a significant role in protein utilization and metabolic regulation. Tailoring recommendations unique to an individual’s varying goals and needs remains a challenge. However, flexibility within the application of DRIs to include consideration of the AMDR provides a sound framework to guide practitioners in effective translation of current dietary guidance with a specific regard for the documented benefits of higher protein intakes.},

However, we are not aware of any epidemiological study examining the time-of-day consumption (afternoon versus evening) of protein on strength and lean mass. The purpose was to examine the associations between afternoon and evening protein consumption, at different protein thresholds (i.e. 15, 20, 25 and 30 g), in relation to leg lean mass and knee extensor strength in men. Dietary protein consumption was assessed using 24-h dietary interview format. Knee extensor strength was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer. Leg lean mass was estimated from whole-body DXA scans. Participants who consumed 20 g, 25 g and 30 g of protein in the evening had greater leg lean mass than those who consumed protein in the afternoon (P{\textless}0·05). However, there was no difference in leg lean mass for 15 g of protein consumption in the evening compared to the afternoon (P{\textgreater}0·05). For strength, there were no differences between evening and afternoon consumption of protein for 15 g, 20 g or 25 g (P{\textgreater}0·05); however, those consuming at least 30 g of protein in the evening had greater knee extensor strength compared to those consuming similar amounts in the afternoon (P = 0·05). These findings suggest that evening protein consumption is associated with greater leg lean mass and knee extensor strength when compared to afternoon protein consumption. Based on these findings, we cautiously hypothesize that there may be a circadian rhythm in muscle protein metabolism.},

In addition, we measured the phosphorylation of candidate signaling proteins thought to regulate acute changes in MPS.Design: Six healthy young men reported to the laboratory on 5 separate occasions to perform an intense bout of leg-based resistance exercise. After exercise, participants consumed, in a randomized order, drinks containing 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 g whole egg protein. Protein synthesis and whole-body leucine oxidation were measured over 4 h after exercise by a primed constant infusion of [1-13C]leucine.Results: MPS displayed a dose response to dietary protein ingestion and was maximally stimulated at 20 g. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Thr389), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser240/244), and the ε-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (Ser539) were unaffected by protein ingestion. APS increased in a dose-dependent manner and also reached a plateau at 20 g ingested protein. Leucine oxidation was significantly increased after 20 and 40 g protein were ingested.Conclusions: Ingestion of 20 g intact protein is sufficient to maximally stimulate MPS and APS after resistance exercise. Phosphorylation of candidate signaling proteins was not enhanced with any dose of protein ingested, which suggested that the stimulation of MPS after resistance exercise may be related to amino acid availability. Finally, dietary protein consumed after exercise in excess of the rate at which it can be incorporated into tissue protein stimulates irreversible oxidation.},

In the present study, a method is developed to dissect the hierarchical regulation into contributions by transcription, translation, protein degradation, and posttranslational modification. The method was applied to the regulation of fluxes through individual glycolytic enzymes when the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was confronted with the absence of oxygen and the presence of benzoic acid depleting its ATP. Metabolic regulation largely contributed to the ≈10-fold change in flux through the glycolytic enzymes. This contribution varied from 50 to 80\%, depending on the glycolytic step and the cultivation condition tested. Within the 50–20\% hierarchical regulation of fluxes, transcription played a minor role, whereas regulation of protein synthesis or degradation was the most important. These also contributed to 75–100\% of the regulation of protein levels.},

Coexpression of proteins in response to pathway-inducing signals is the founding paradigm of gene regulation. However, it remains unexplored whether the relative abundance of co-regulated proteins requires precise tuning. Here, we present large-scale analyses of protein stoichiometry and corresponding regulatory strategies for 21 pathways and 67–224 operons in divergent bacteria separated by 0.6–2 billion years. Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities.},

Cytochrome oxidases (cydAB, cyoABCD, and cbdAB) were removed from the E. coli K12 MG1655 genome, resulting in the ECOM3 (E. coli cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain. Removal of cytochrome oxidases reduced the oxygen uptake rate of the knockout strain by nearly 85\%. Moreover, the knockout strain was initially incapable of growing on M9 minimal medium. After the ECOM3 strain was subjected to adaptive evolution on glucose M9 medium for 60 days, a growth rate equivalent to that of anaerobic wild-type E. coli was achieved. Our findings demonstrate that three independently adaptively evolved ECOM3 populations acquired different phenotypes: one produced lactate as a sole fermentation product, while the other two strains exhibited a mixed-acid fermentation under oxic growth conditions with lactate remaining as the major product. The homofermenting strain showed a d-lactate yield of 0.8 g/g from glucose. Gene expression and in silico model-based analyses were employed to identify perturbed pathways and explain phenotypic behavior. Significant upregulation of ygiN and sodAB explains the remaining oxygen uptake that was observed in evolved ECOM3 strains. E. coli strains produced in this study showed the ability to produce lactate as a fermentation product from glucose and to undergo mixed-acid fermentation during aerobic growth.},

A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds.

To this end, we provide an overview of two complementary stoichiometry-based pathway design tools optStoic and novoStoic developed in our group to tackle these challenges. optStoic is designed to determine the stoichiometry of overall conversion first which optimizes a performance criterion (e.g. high carbon/energy efficiency) and ensures a comprehensive search of co-metabolites and cofactors. The procedure then identifies the minimum number of intervening reactions to connect the source and sink metabolites. We also further the pathway design procedure by expanding the search space to include both known and hypothetical reactions, represented by reaction rules, in a new tool termed novoStoic. Reaction rules are derived based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) compatible reaction operator, which allow us to explore natural promiscuous enzymes, engineer candidate enzymes that are not already promiscuous as well as design de novo enzymes. The identified biochemical reaction rules then guide novoStoic to design routes that expand the currently known biotransformation space using a single MILP modeling procedure. We demonstrate the use of the two computational tools in pathway elucidation by designing novel synthetic routes for isobutanol.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic states of the central metabolism in a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain producing mevalonate (MVA) were studied to identify metabolic reactions with regulatory function for improvement of the specific rate of MVA production. Intracellular concentrations of metabolites were determined for E. coli strains expressing Enterococcus faecalis genes mvaE and mvaS (strain MV) by gas chromatography (GC)- and liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS). Mixtures of 13C-labeled metabolites served as internal standards were prepared from E. coli cultured in a completely 13C-labeled medium. Based on the concentration data, the change in Gibbs energy (ΔG) and substrate saturation ([S]/KM) were calculated for each metabolic reaction and then compared between the control and MVA-producing strains. The thermodynamic and kinetic analyses showed that further activation of thermodynamically feasible reactions in the upper part of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway seems difficult and that metabolic bypassing to the Entner–Doudoroff pathway was a promising strategy to improve the acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and NADPH supply required for MVA biosynthesis. Strain MV-ΔGndΔGntR was constructed by deletion of the gnd and gntR genes, which respectively encode 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and a negative regulator of the expression of two enzyme genes responsible for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Cultivation in the nongrowth phase revealed that the yield and specific production rate of MVA increased to 0.49 ± 0.01 Cmol (Cmol glucose)−1 and 2.61 ± 0.10 mmol (g dry cell weight)−1 h−1, which were 113\% and 158\% that of the MV strain, respectively.},

	abstract = {So-called futile cycles in cellular metabolism consist of paired opposing reactions that, if simultaneously operant, act only to degrade free energy of ATP to heat. Previous considerations of the behavior of such substrate cycles have indicated their possible usefulness in regulating flux along metabolic pathways, but such analyses have treated the cycles in isolation, i.e. without taking into account the effects of enzymatic inputs to and outputs from the cycle. We here develop models of three typical substrate cycles that include enzymatic inputs to and outputs from the cycle and allow the enzymes of the cycles per se to be subject to a variety of allosteric modulations. The non-linear equations which describe these models were solved by an iterative procedure for sets of parameter values of metabolic interest. The results, when analyzed using appropriate definitions of regulatory sensitivity and energetic futility, demonstrate that the effects of the enzymes leading into and out of the cycle may cause profound changes in the operation of the substrate cycle and therefore may not be ignored. We find that the structural differences among the three cycles considered here result in corresponding functional differences. Our results suggest that (1) the fructose-6-P/fructose-1,6-di-P cycle acts effectively to gate bidirectional flux, but doesn't appreciably enhance regulation of unidirectional flux, (2) the glucose/glucose-6-P cycle is well suited to perform a homeostatic function and to adjust the set points for these two metabolites, and (3) the cycle at the pyruvate crossroads functions largely as a complex switch box that directs metabolic flow towards gluconeogenesis or glycolysis not only in response to inputs of or requirements for oxaloacetate, pyruvate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, but also in response to the combined action of allosteric modulators on the individual enzymes of this substrate cycle.},

	abstract = {High titer 1-butanol production in Escherichia coli has previously been achieved by overexpression of a modified clostridial 1-butanol production pathway and subsequent deletion of native fermentation pathways. This strategy couples growth with production as 1-butanol pathway offers the only available terminal electron acceptors required for growth in anaerobic conditions. With further inclusion of other well-established metabolic engineering principles, a titer of 15g/L has been obtained. In achieving this titer, many currently existing strategies have been exhausted, and 1-butanol toxicity level has been surpassed. Therefore, continued engineering of the host strain for increased production requires implementation of alternative strategies that seek to identify non-obvious targets for improvement. In this study, a metabolomics-driven approach was used to reveal a CoA imbalance resulting from a pta deletion that caused undesirable accumulation of pyruvate, butanoate, and other CoA-derived compounds. Using metabolomics, the reduction of butanoyl-CoA to butanal catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE2 was determined as a rate-limiting step. Fine-tuning of this activity and subsequent release of free CoA restored the CoA balance that resulted in a titer of 18.3g/L upon improvement of total free CoA levels using cysteine supplementation. By enhancing AdhE2 activity, carbon flux was directed towards 1-butanol production and undesirable accumulation of pyruvate and butanoate was diminished. This study represents the initial report describing the improvement of 1-butanol production in E. coli by resolving CoA imbalance, which was based on metabolome analysis and rational metabolic engineering strategies.},

In 1909 Saburosuke Suzuki, an entrepreneur, and Ikeda began the industrial production of monosodium l-glutamate (MSG). The first industrial production process was an extraction method in which vegetable proteins were treated with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds. l-Glutamic acid hydrochloride was then isolated from this material and purified as MSG. Initial production of MSG was limited because of the technical drawbacks of this method. Better methods did not emerge until the 1950s. One of these was direct chemical synthesis, which was used from 1962 to 1973. In this procedure, acrylonitrile was the starting material, and optical resolution of dl-glutamic acid was achieved by preferential crystallization. In 1956 a direct fermentation method to produce glutamate was introduced. The advantages of the fermentation method (eg, reduction of production costs and environmental load) were large enough to cause all glutamate manufacturers to shift to fermentation. Today, total world production of MSG by fermentation is estimated to be 2 million tons/y (2 billion kg/y). However, future production growth will likely require further innovation.},

Experimentally, these fluxes can be measured by 13C-flux analysis, and there has been a long-standing interest in understanding this functional network operation from an evolutionary perspective. On the basis of 13C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms’ environmental context.
A key design principle of bacterial metabolic networks is optimal performance, but not at the expense of adaptability.

	abstract = {After hundreds of generations of adaptive evolution at exponential growth, Escherichia coli grows as predicted using flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome‐scale metabolic models (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild‐type and evolved strains. Here, we report that {\textgreater}98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild‐type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM‐computed optimal growth states.
Visual Overview
SynopsisWhen prokaryotes are maintained at early‐ to mid‐log phase growth through serial passaging for hundreds of generations, the strains improve fitness and evolve a higher growth rate (Lenski and Travisano, 1994; Ibarra et al, 2002). This increased growth rate is the result of the appearance of a few causal mutations (Herring et al, 2006; Conrad et al, 2009). In Escherichia coli, these altered growth phenotypes are consistent with predictions from genome‐scale models of metabolism (GEMs) (Ibarra et al, 2002; Fong and Palsson, 2004). However, it is still not known (1) whether absolute gene and protein expression levels and expression changes are consistent with optimal growth predictions from in silico GEMs or (2) whether measured expression changes can be linked to physiological changes that are based on known mechanisms or pathways. In this study, we begin to address these questions using constraint‐based modeling of E. coli K‐12 metabolism (Feist and Palsson, 2008) to analyze omic data that document the expression changes in E. coli under adaptive evolution in three different growth conditions.Mapping high‐throughput data to a network can be useful for interpretation. However, it does not account for upstream and downstream effects of gene and protein expression changes. The analysis of data in the context of GEMs can suggest if predicted activity is consistent with the data. For this work, we used a variant of flux balance analysis (FBA), called Parsimonious enzyme usage FBA (pFBA) (Figure 1), to classify all genes according to whether they are used in the optimal growth solutions. Results from these models were compared with the data to assess whether the data were consistent with genes and proteins within the predicted optimal solutions, and whether the expression changes were consistent with measured physiology. Through this analysis, we find that the data provide a high coverage of genes that contribute to the optimal growth solutions (Figure 1B). In fact, the union of the proteomic and transcriptomic data for non‐essential genes provides support for 97.7\% of all non‐essential gene‐associated reactions within the optimal growth predictions. Thus, the spectrum of expressed genes and proteins is consistent with the pathway utilization that is predicted for these optimal growth phenotypes.Laboratory‐evolved strains attain a higher growth rate. This higher growth rate is usually associated with an increased substrate uptake rate (Ibarra et al, 2002; Fong et al, 2005) and in some cases more efficient metabolism (Ibarra et al, 2002). Both of these properties are also witnessed in the strains studied here. It has been reported that in most cases, evolved strain growth phenotype is consistent with GEM predictions (Ibarra et al, 2002; Teusink et al, 2009). Here, we evaluate whether the laboratory‐evolved strains adjust the gene and protein expression levels in accordance with pathway usage in the optimal growth predictions. Essential and non‐essential genes and proteins within the optimal growth solutions are significantly upregulated (Figure 1B). This suggests that these proteins may be acting as bottlenecks that are relieved through the adaptive process, thereby allowing for a higher substrate uptake rate and growth rate. However, genes and proteins associated with reactions that cannot carry a flux in the given growth conditions are downregulated in the evolved strains (Figure 1B). Furthermore, there is downregulation of genes associated with less efficient pathways (Figure 5C). Thus, the omic data support the emergence of the predicted optimal growth states, consistent with the increased substrate uptake upstream and the increased biomass production downstream of these internal pathways.Regulatory mechanisms, both known and unknown, are responsible for the changes seen here. Across all data sets, several metabolic regulons are significantly downregulated. However, no known regulons were enriched among upregulated genes or proteins for all but one data set. Aside from just regulating the metabolic pathways directly, these mechanisms lead to additional physiological changes. For example, in the minimal media growth conditions used here, the stringent response normally represses growth while upregulating amino‐acid biosynthetic processes. However, evolved strain gene expression shows a suppression of the stringent response, as evolved strain gene expression shows either no expression change or changes opposite to the normal stringent response.The implications of this work are as follows: (1) genome‐scale gene and protein expression data are consistent with FBA computed optimal growth states, and evolved strains reinforce these optimal states; (2) genome‐scale models will have an important function bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype; and (3) the development of additional genome‐scale models of other growth‐related processes such as transcription and translation (Thiele et al, 2009) will have an important function in elucidating the mechanisms that contribute the most to altered phenotypes (Lewis et al, 2009a). In addition, reconstruction of the transcriptional regulation network will aid in identifying the control of expression changes seen in the other systems.
Proteomic and transcriptomic data from wild‐type and laboratory‐evolved strains of Escherichia coli are consistent with predicted pathway usage from optimal growth rate solutions.In laboratory‐evolved strains, there is an upregulation of the pathways in the computed optimal growth states, and downregulation of non‐functional pathways.Known regulatory mechanisms are only partially responsible for altered metabolic pathway activity.},

In the model, the problem is to arrive at five boxes containing six balls each, having started with six boxes containing five balls each, where boxes simulate the sugars and balls simulate the carbons in each. This is achieved by means of transferrring two or three balls from any box to any other in each step, according to transketolase and transaldolase (or aldolase) mechanisms which account for sugar interconversions in the living cell. A hypothesis of simplicity is imposed in order to arrive at the objective with the least number of steps and with the least number of balls in the intermediary boxes. A symmetrical solution is obtained, demonstrating that this is the simplest solution, which is the procedure carried out by biological systems. The same treatment is applied for sugar rearrangement in the non-oxidative phase of the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis and the analysis of the “l-type” of pentose phosphate cycle is also treated, obtaining similar solutions in both cases, which allow us to make some physiological reflections.},

	abstract = {Food loss is widely recognized as undermining food security and environmental sustainability. However, consumption of resource-intensive food items instead of more efficient, equally nutritious alternatives can also be considered as an effective food loss. Here we define and quantify these opportunity food losses as the food loss associated with consuming resource-intensive animal-based items instead of plant-based alternatives which are nutritionally comparable, e.g., in terms of protein content. We consider replacements that minimize cropland use for each of the main US animal-based food categories. We find that although the characteristic conventional retail-to-consumer food losses are ≈30\% for plant and animal products, the opportunity food losses of beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs are 96\%, 90\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 40\%, respectively. This arises because plant-based replacement diets can produce 20-fold and twofold more nutritionally similar food per cropland than beef and eggs, the most and least resource-intensive animal categories, respectively. Although conventional and opportunity food losses are both targets for improvement, the high opportunity food losses highlight the large potential savings beyond conventionally defined food losses. Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the US diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste. These results highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.},

Some of the kinetic constants needed for a model could be collected from ever-growing literature and public web resources, but they are often incomplete, incompatible, or simply not available. We address this lack of information by parameter balancing, a method to complete given sets of kinetic constants. Based on Bayesian parameter estimation, it exploits the thermodynamic dependencies among different biochemical quantities to guess realistic model parameters from available kinetic data. Our algorithm accounts for varying measurement conditions in the input data (pH value and temperature). It can process kinetic constants and state-dependent quantities such as metabolite concentrations or chemical potentials, and uses prior distributions and data augmentation to keep the estimated quantities within plausible ranges. An online service and free software for parameter balancing with models provided in SBML format (Systems Biology Markup Language) is accessible at www.semanticsbml.org. We demonstrate its practical use with a small model of the phosphofructokinase reaction and discuss its possible applications and limitations. In the future, parameter balancing could become an important routine step in the kinetic modeling of large metabolic networks.},

Dietary choices control food availability and natural resource demands. In particular, reducing or avoiding consumption of low production efficiency animal-based products can spare resources that can then yield more food. In quantifying the potential food gains of specific dietary shifts, most earlier research focused on calories, with less attention to other important nutrients, notably protein. Moreover, despite the well-known environmental burdens of livestock, only a handful of national level feed-to-food conversion efficiency estimates of dairy, beef, poultry, pork, and eggs exist. Yet such high level estimates are essential for reducing diet related environmental impacts and identifying optimal food gain paths. Here we quantify caloric and protein conversion efficiencies for US livestock categories. We then use these efficiencies to calculate the food availability gains expected from replacing beef in the US diet with poultry, a more efficient meat, and a plant-based alternative. Averaged over all categories, caloric and protein efficiencies are 7\%–8\%. At 3\% in both metrics, beef is by far the least efficient. We find that reallocating the agricultural land used for beef feed to poultry feed production can meet the caloric and protein demands of ≈120 and ≈140 million additional people consuming the mean American diet, respectively, roughly 40\% of current US population.},

A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations.

These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.},

	abstract = {Energy metabolism is central to cellular biology. Thus, genome-scale models of heterotrophic unicellular species must account appropriately for the utilization of external nutrients to synthesize energy metabolites such as ATP. However, metabolic models designed for flux-balance analysis (FBA) may contain thermodynamically impossible energy-generating cycles: without nutrient consumption, these models are still capable of charging energy metabolites (such as ADP→ATP or NADP+→NADPH). Here, we show that energy-generating cycles occur in over 85\% of metabolic models without extensive manual curation, such as those contained in the ModelSEED and MetaNetX databases; in contrast, such cycles are rare in the manually curated models of the BiGG database. Energy generating cycles may represent model errors, e.g., erroneous assumptions on reaction reversibilities. Alternatively, part of the cycle may be thermodynamically feasible in one environment, while the remainder is thermodynamically feasible in another environment; as standard FBA does not account for thermodynamics, combining these into an FBA model allows erroneous energy generation. The presence of energy-generating cycles typically inflates maximal biomass production rates by 25\%, and may lead to biases in evolutionary simulations. We present efficient computational methods (i) to identify energy generating cycles, using FBA, and (ii) to identify minimal sets of model changes that eliminate them, using a variant of the GlobalFit algorithm.},

	abstract = {An optimization-based framework is introduced for testing whether experimental flux data are consistent with different hypothesized objective functions. Specifically, we examine whether the maximization of a weighted combination of fluxes can explain a set of observed experimental data. Coefficients of importance (CoIs) are identified that quantify the fraction of the additive contribution of a given flux to a fitness (objective) function with an optimization that can explain the experimental flux data. A high CoI value implies that the experimental flux data are consistent with the hypothesis that the corresponding flux is maximized by the network, whereas a low value implies the converse. This framework (i.e., ObjFind) is applied to both an aerobic and anaerobic set of Escherichia coli flux data derived from isotopomer analysis. Results reveal that the CoIs for both growth conditions are strikingly similar, even though the flux distributions for the two cases are quite different, which is consistent with the presence of a single metabolic objective driving the flux distributions in both cases. Interestingly, the CoI associated with a biomass production flux, complete with energy and reducing power requirements, assumes a value 9 and 15 times higher than the next largest coefficient for the aerobic and anaerobic cases, respectively.  © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this work, the computational OptKnock framework is introduced for suggesting gene deletion strategies leading to the overproduction of chemicals or biochemicals in E. coli. This is accomplished by ensuring that a drain towards growth resources (i.e., carbon, redox potential, and energy) must be accompanied, due to stoichiometry, by the production of a desired product. Computational results for gene deletions for succinate, lactate, and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) production are in good agreement with mutant strains published in the literature. While some of the suggested deletion strategies are straightforward and involve eliminating competing reaction pathways, many others suggest complex and nonintuitive mechanisms of compensating for the removed functionalities. Finally, the OptKnock procedure, by coupling biomass formation with chemical production, hints at a growth selection/adaptation system for indirectly evolving overproducing mutants. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals.

By quantifying metabolic fluxes and global mRNA abundance, we investigated the genetic and metabolic mechanisms that underlie adaptive evolution of four metabolic gene deletion mutants of Escherichia coli (Δpgi, Δppc, Δpta, and Δtpi) in parallel evolution experiments of each mutant. The initial response to the gene deletions was flux rerouting through local bypass reactions or normally latent pathways. The principal effect of evolution was improved capacity of already active pathways, whereas new flux distributions were not observed. Combinatorial changes in capacity and pathway activation, however, led to different intracellular flux states that enabled evolution in three of the four parallel cases tested. The molecular bases of the evolved phenotypes were then elucidated by global mRNA transcript analyses. Activation of latent pathways and flux changes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were found to correlate well with molecular changes at the transcriptional level. Flux alterations in other central metabolic pathways, in contrast, were apparently not connected to changes in the transcriptional network. These results give new insight into the dynamics of the evolutionary process by demonstrating the flexibility of the metabolic network of E. coli to compensate for genetic perturbations and the utility of combining multiple high throughput data sets to differentiate between causal and noncausal mechanistic changes.},

The parallel operation of eight such mini-scale chemostats was exploited for systematic 13C analysis of intracellular fluxes over a broad range of growth rates in glucose-limited Escherichia coli. As expected, physiological variables changed monotonously with the dilution rate, allowing for the assessment of maintenance metabolism. Despite the linear dependence of total cellular carbon influx on dilution rate, the distribution of almost all major fluxes varied nonlinearly with dilution rate. Most prominent were the distinct maximum of glyoxylate shunt activity and the concomitant minimum of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at low to intermediate dilution rates of 0.05 to 0.2 h−1. During growth on glucose, this glyoxylate shunt activity is best understood from a network perspective as the recently described phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate cycle that oxidizes PEP (or pyruvate) to CO2. At higher or extremely low dilution rates, in vivo PEP-glyoxylate cycle activity was low or absent. The step increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity at around 0.2 h−1 was not related to the cellular demand for the reduction equivalent NADPH, since NADPH formation was 20 to 50\% in excess of the anabolic demand at all dilution rates. The results demonstrate that mini-scale continuous cultivation enables quantitative and parallel characterization of intra- and extracellular phenotypes in steady state, thereby greatly reducing workload and costs for stable-isotope experiments.},

	abstract = {Boosting the antibiotics pipeline
Antibiotic discovery requires innovative phenotypic assays to identify the mode of action of compounds during large-scale drug screening. Now, Zampieri et al. have developed a high-throughput method to systematically quantify and interpret dynamic metabolome responses of mycobacteria to new antimicrobial compounds. They demonstrate how one can infer the mode of action of uncharacterized antimycobacterial compounds by comparing drug-induced metabolic responses in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Their combined mass spectrometry–based metabolomics and computational workflow scaled with the size of typical compound libraries and hence could facilitate the selection of antimicrobial compound leads with potentially new modes of action.
Rapidly spreading antibiotic resistance and the low discovery rate of new antimicrobial compounds demand more effective strategies for early drug discovery. One bottleneck in the drug discovery pipeline is the identification of the modes of action (MoAs) of new compounds. We have developed a rapid systematic metabolome profiling strategy to classify the MoAs of bioactive compounds. The method predicted MoA-specific metabolic responses in the nonpathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis after treatment with 62 reference compounds with known MoAs and different metabolic and nonmetabolic targets. We then analyzed a library of 212 new antimycobacterial compounds with unknown MoAs from a drug discovery effort by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). More than 70\% of these new compounds induced metabolic responses in M. smegmatis indicative of known MoAs, seven of which were experimentally validated. Only 8\% (16) of the compounds appeared to target unconventional cellular processes, illustrating the difficulty in discovering new antibiotics with different MoAs among compounds used as monotherapies. For six of the GSK compounds with potentially new MoAs, the metabolome profiles suggested their ability to interfere with trehalose and lipid metabolism. This was supported by whole-genome sequencing of spontaneous drug-resistant mutants of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in vitro compound-proteome interaction analysis for one of these compounds. Our compendium of drug-metabolome profiles can be used to rapidly query the MoAs of uncharacterized antimicrobial compounds and should be a useful resource for the drug discovery community.
The mode of action of new antimicrobial compounds can be predicted from changes in metabolome profiles in Mycobacterium.

Genomics is providing near complete information regarding the genes/gene products participating in cellular metabolism for a growing number of organisms. As the true functional units of metabolic systems are its pathways, the time has arrived to define metabolic pathways in the context of whole-cell metabolism for the analysis of the structural design and capabilities of the metabolic network. In this study, we present the theoretical foundations for the identification of the unique set of systemically independent biochemical pathways, termed extreme pathways, based on system stochiometry and limited thermodynamics. These pathways represent the edges of the steady-state flux cone derived from convex analysis, and they can be used to represent any flux distribution achievable by the metabolic network. An algorithm is presented to determine the set of extreme pathways for a system of any complexity and a classification scheme is introduced for the characterization of these pathways. The property of systemic independence is discussed along with its implications for issues related to metabolic regulation and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks. The underlying pathway structure that is determined from the set of extreme pathways now provides us with the ability to analyse, interpret, and perhaps predict metabolic function from a pathway-based perspective in addition to the traditional reaction-based perspective. The algorithm and classification scheme developed can be used to describe the pathway structure in annotated genomes to explore the capabilities of an organism.},

However, analysing an isolated subnetwork can result in finding incorrect EMs which are not part of any steady-state flux distribution of the original network. The ideal set to describe the reaction activity in a subnetwork would be the set of all EMs projected to the reactions of interest.

In contrast to clinical hematology analyzers, where cells are sphered in order for both volume and hemoglobin to be measured accurately, the QAC measures cells in their normal physiological shape. Human red blood cells are suspended in a refractive index-matching absorbing buffer, driven through a microfluidic channel, and imaged using a transmission light microscope onto a color camera. A red and a blue LED illuminate cells and images at each color are used to independently retrieve cell volume and hemoglobin mass. This system shows good agreement with red blood cell indices retrieved by a clinical hematology analyzer and in fact measures a smaller coefficient of variation of hemoglobin concentration. In addition to cell indices, the QAC returns height and mass maps of each measured cell. These quantitative images are valuable for analyzing the detailed morphology of individual cells as well as statistical outliers found in the data. We also measured red blood cells in hypertonic and hypotonic buffers to quantify the correlation between volume and hemoglobin mass under osmotic stress.

Aided by constraint programming and quadratic optimization, our platform based on machine learning (ML) can predict meaningful metabolic information about bacterial species in their environments. Further, it can offer constraints to improve the accuracy of flux balance analysis. This study infers that the bacterial metabolic network has a certain degree of rigidity in allocating carbon fluxes, and different microbial species may share common regulatory strategies for balancing carbon and energy metabolisms. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the use of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, e.g., ML, may assist mechanistic based models to elucidate the topology of microbial fluxomes.},

Organisms were found to qualitatively prefer hydrophilic and charged metabolites, a phenomenon that was explained to be a result of constraints imposed by contemporary as well as archaic metabolism. However, among the metabolites that are used, a quantitative preference has never been analyzed systematically. Here we use the most comprehensive data sets of metabolite concentrations available to explore such trends. We find that in various organisms and growth conditions, living cells minimize the concentrations of non-polar, un-charged metabolites. More specifically, metabolites' hydrophobicity alters concentrations by two orders of magnitudes on average and explains up to half of the variation of metabolite concentrations within cells. We suggest that this can be attributed to an evolutionary pressure to avoid an unspecific hydrophobic effect: the preference of hydrophobic surfaces in an aqueous environment to adhere to other hydrophobic surfaces. Our findings shed light on the evolution of the internal makeup of living cells and can assist in establishing metabolic models that support synthetic biology and metabolic engineering efforts.},

On the other hand, more detailed kinetic models which use ordinary differential equations to simulate fluxes for different choices of enzyme allocation, are computationally demanding and not scalable enough. In this work, we developed a method which utilizes the full kinetic model to predict steady-state enzyme costs, using a scalable and robust algorithm based on convex optimization. We show that the minimization of enzyme cost is a meaningful optimality principle by comparing our predictions to measured enzyme and metabolite levels in exponentially growing E. coli. This method could be used to quantify the enzyme cost of many other pathways and explain why evolution has selected some low-yield metabolic strategies, including aerobic fermentation in yeast and cancer cells. Furthermore, future metabolic engineering projects could benefit from our method by choosing pathways that reduce the total amount of enzyme required for the synthesis of a value-added product.},

These analyses can aid experimentalists in tuning enzyme expression levels along a metabolic pathway. In this work, we offer a framework that is complementary to MCA. Rather than focusing on the relationship between enzyme levels and pathway flux, we examine a pathway's stoichiometry and thermodynamics and ask whether it is likely to support high flux in cellular conditions. Our framework calculates a single thermodynamically-derived metric (the MDF) for each pathway, which is convenient for selecting the promising pathways from a large collection. This approach has several advantages. First, enzyme kinetic properties are laborious to measure and differ between organisms and isozymes, but no kinetic data is required to calculate the MDF. Second, as our framework accounts for pH, ionic strength and allowed concentration ranges, it is simple to model the effect of these parameters on the MDF. Finally, as it can be difficult to control the exact expression level of enzymes within cells, the MDF helps identify alternative pathways that are less sensitive to the levels of their constituent enzymes.},

Although metabolic biochemical pathways are well understood, less is known about precisely how reaction rates or fluxes through the various enzymes are controlled. Hackett et al. developed a method to quantitate such regulatory influence in yeast. They monitored concentrations of metabolites, enzymes, and potential regulators by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) and isotope ratio measurements for 56 reactions, over 100 metabolites, and 370 metabolic enzymes in yeast in 25 different steady-state conditions. Bayesian analysis was used to examine the probability of regulatory interactions. Regulation of flux through the pathways was predominantly controlled by changes in the concentration of small-molecule metabolites rather than changes in enzyme abundance. The analysis also revealed previously unrecognized regulation between pathways.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMetabolism is among the most strongly conserved processes across all domains of life and is crucial for both bioengineering and disease research, yet we still have an unclear understanding of how metabolic rates (fluxes) are determined. Qualitatively, this deficiency involves missing knowledge of enzyme regulators. Quantitatively, it involves limited understanding of the relative contributions of enzyme and metabolite concentrations in controlling flux across physiological conditions. Addressing these gaps has been challenging because in vitro biochemical approaches lack the physiological context, whereas models of cellular metabolic dynamics have limited capacity for identifying or quantitating specific regulatory events because of overall model complexity.
RATIONALEFlux through individual metabolic reactions is directly determined by the concentrations of enzyme, substrates, products, and any allosteric regulators, as captured quantitatively by a Michaelis-Menten–style reaction equation. Analogous to how experimental variation of reaction species in vitro allows for the inference of regulators and reaction equation kinetic parameters, physiological changes in flux entail a change in reaction species that can be used to determine reaction equations on the basis of cellular data. This requires measurement across multiple biological conditions of flux, enzyme concentrations, and metabolite concentrations. We reasoned that chemostat cultures could be used to induce predictable and strong flux changes, with changes in enzymes and metabolites measurable by proteomics and metabolomics. By directly relating cellular flux to the reaction species that determine it, we can carry out regulatory inference at the level of single metabolic reactions by using cellular data. An important benefit is that the physiological significance of any identified regulator is implicit from its role in determining cellular flux.
RESULTSHere we introduce systematic identification of meaningful metabolic enzyme regulation (SIMMER). We measured fluxes, and metabolite and enzyme concentrations, in each of 25 yeast chemostats. For each of 56 reactions for which the flux, enzyme, and substrates were measured, we determined whether variation in measured flux could be explained by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We also evaluated alternative models of each reaction’s kinetics that included a suite of allosteric regulators drawn from across all organisms. For 46 reactions, we were able to identify a useful kinetic model, with 17 reactions not including any regulation and 29 reactions being regulated by one to two allosteric regulators. Three previously unrecognized cross-pathway regulatory interactions were validated biochemically. These included inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate and inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylase by phenypyruvate. These metabolites accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow and ethanol production in nitrogen-limited yeast. For well-supported reaction forms, we were able to determine the extent to which nutrient-based changes in flux were determined by changes in the concentrations of individual reaction species. We find that substrates are the most important determinant of fluxes in general, with enzymes and allosteric regulators having a comparably important role in the case of physiologically irreversible reactions.
CONCLUSIONBy connecting changes in flux to their root cause, SIMMER parallels classic in vitro approaches, but it allows simultaneous testing of numerous regulators of many reactions under physiological conditions. Its application to yeast showed that changes in flux across nutrient conditions are predominantly due to metabolite, not enzyme, levels. Thus, yeast metabolism is substantially self-regulating. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/354/6311/aaf2786/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Integrative analysis of fluxes and metabolite and enzyme concentrations by SIMMER.Measured flux is related, on a reaction-by-reaction basis, to enzyme and metabolite concentrations through a Michaelis-Menten equation. The extent to which variation in flux across experimental conditions can be explained by the enzyme, substrates, and products is assessed. If unregulated kinetics disagrees with the measured flux, we test a set of possible allosteric regulators to determine which, if any, regulators are supported on the basis of improvement in fit.
Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.

Metabolite-protein interactions control a variety of cellular processes, thereby playing a major role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Metabolites comprise the largest fraction of molecules in cells, but our knowledge of the metabolite-protein interactome lags behind our understanding of protein-protein or protein-DNA interactomes. Here, we present a chemoproteomic workflow for the systematic identification of metabolite-protein interactions directly in their native environment. The approach identified a network of known and novel interactions and binding sites in Escherichia coli, and we demonstrated the functional relevance of a number of newly identified interactions. Our data enabled identification of new enzyme-substrate relationships and cases of metabolite-induced remodeling of protein complexes. Our metabolite-protein interactome consists of 1,678 interactions and 7,345 putative binding sites. Our data reveal functional and structural principles of chemical communication, shed light on the prevalence and mechanisms of enzyme promiscuity, and enable extraction of quantitative parameters of metabolite binding on a proteome-wide scale.},

	abstract = {A novel in vivo method of producing succinate has been developed. A genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain has been constructed to meet the NADH requirement and carbon demand to produce high quantities and yield of succinate by strategically implementing metabolic pathway alterations. Currently, the maximum theoretical succinate yield under strictly anaerobic conditions through the fermentative succinate biosynthesis pathway is limited to one mole per mole of glucose due to NADH limitation. The implemented strategic design involves the construction of a dual succinate synthesis route, which diverts required quantities of NADH through the traditional fermentative pathway and maximizes the carbon converted to succinate by balancing the carbon flux through the fermentative pathway and the glyoxylate pathway (which has less NADH requirement). The synthesis of succinate uses a combination of the two pathways to balance the NADH. Consequently, experimental results indicated that these combined pathways gave the most efficient conversion of glucose to succinate with the highest yield using only 1.25moles of NADH per mole of succinate in contrast to the sole fermentative pathway, which uses 2moles of NADH per mole of succinate. A recombinant E. coli strain, SBS550MG, was created by deactivating adhE, ldhA and ack-pta from the central metabolic pathway and by activating the glyoxylate pathway through the inactivation of iclR, which encodes a transcriptional repressor protein of the glyoxylate bypass. The inactivation of these genes in SBS550MG increased the succinate yield from glucose to about 1.6mol/mol with an average anaerobic productivity rate of 10mM/h(∼0.64mM/h-OD600). This strain is capable of fermenting high concentrations of glucose in less than 24h. Additional derepression of the glyxoylate pathway by inactivation of arcA, leading to a strain designated as SBS660MG, did not signicantly increase the succinate yield and it decreased glucose consumption by 80\%. It was also observed that an adhE, ldhA and ack-pta mutant designated as SBS990MG, was able to achieve a high succinate yield similar to SBS550MG when expressing a Bacillus subtilis NADH-insensitive citrate synthase from a plasmid.},

	abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful technique for elucidating in vivo fluxes in microbial and mammalian systems. A key step in 13C-MFA is the selection of an appropriate isotopic tracer to observe fluxes in a proposed network model. Despite the importance of MFA in metabolic engineering and beyond, current approaches for tracer experiment design are still largely based on trial-and-error. The lack of a rational methodology for selecting isotopic tracers prevents MFA from achieving its full potential. Here, we introduce a new technique for tracer experiment design based on the concept of elementary metabolite unit (EMU) basis vectors. We demonstrate that any metabolite in a network model can be expressed as a linear combination of so-called EMU basis vectors, where the corresponding coefficients indicate the fractional contribution of the EMU basis vector to the product metabolite. The strength of this approach is the decoupling of substrate labeling, i.e. the EMU basis vectors, from the dependence on free fluxes, i.e. the coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate that flux observability inherently depends on the number of independent EMU basis vectors and the sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes. Specifically, the number of independent EMU basis vectors places hard limits on how many free fluxes can be determined in a model. This constraint is used as a guide for selecting feasible substrate labeling. In three example models, we demonstrate that by maximizing the number of independent EMU basis vectors the observability of a system is improved. Inspection of sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes provides additional constraints for proper selection of tracers. The present contribution provides a fresh perspective on an important topic in metabolic engineering, and gives practical guidelines and design principles for a priori selection of isotopic tracers for 13C-MFA studies.},

We applied these techniques to a previously published isotope mapping model of Escherichia coli accounting for 238 reactions. We find that the combined use of EMU and flux coupling analysis leads to a ten-fold decrease in the number of variables in comparison to the original isotope distribution vector (IDV) version of the model. In addition, using OptMeas the task of identifying additional measurement choices to fully specify the flows in the metabolic network required only 2\% of the computation time of the one using IDVs.

Tools to rationally reconfigure microbial metabolism for these potentially conflicting objectives remain limited. Exhaustively exploring combinations of genetic modifications is both experimentally and computationally inefficient, and can become intractable when multiple gene deletions or insertions need to be considered. Alternatively, the search for desirable gene modifications may be solved heuristically as an evolutionary optimization problem.

These properties were computed for the production of individual amino acids and protein production in Helicobacter pylori and individual amino acid production in Haemophilus influenzae. Reaction participation classifies the reactions into groups that are always, sometimes, or never utilized for the production of a target product. The utilized reactions can be further grouped into correlated subsets of reactions, some of which are non-obvious, and which may, in turn, suggest regulatory structure. The length of the extreme pathways did not correlate with product yield or chemical complexity. The distributions of extreme pathway lengths in H. pylori were also very different from those in H. influenzae, showing a distinct systemic difference between the two organisms, despite overall similar metabolic networks.

The metabolites from free glucose in the medium equilibrated with those from free galactose in the medium, but did not equilibrate with metabolic products derived from glucose generated endogenously by the hydrolysis of lactose. Similarly, metabolic products derived from galactose formed in the hydrolysis of lactose equilibrated with those from glucose from the same source, but not with metabolic intermediates formed from either free glucose or free galactose in the medium.

Physiologic and environmental factors can modulate antibiotic activity and thus pose a significant challenge to antibiotic treatment. The quinolone class of antibiotics, which targets bacterial topoisomerases, fails to kill bacteria that have grown to high density; however, the mechanistic basis for this persistence is unclear. Here, we show that exhaustion of the metabolic inputs that couple carbon catabolism to oxidative phosphorylation is a primary cause of growth phase-dependent persistence to quinolone antibiotics. Supplementation of stationary-phase cultures with glucose and a suitable terminal electron acceptor to stimulate respiratory metabolism is sufficient to sensitize cells to quinolone killing. Using this approach, we successfully sensitize high-density populations of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis to quinolone antibiotics. Our findings link growth-dependent quinolone persistence to discrete impairments in respiratory metabolism and identify a strategy to kill non-dividing bacteria.},

Classically, it is thought that citrate synthase only works in one direction: to catalyze the production of citrate from acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle can run in reverse to cleave citrate and fix carbon dioxide autotrophically, but this was thought to occur only with alternative enzymes, such as citrate lyase. Now Nunoura et al. and Mall et al. have discovered thermophilic bacteria with highly efficient and reversible citrate synthase that requires reduced ferredoxin (see the Perspective by Ragsdale). This function is undetectable by metagenomics, but classical biochemistry filled in the gaps seen between the genome sequences and the phenotypes of the organisms. The direction of catalysis depends on the availability of organic versus inorganic carbon and reflects a flexible bet-hedging strategy for survival in fluctuating environments. In evolutionary terms, this capacity might predate the classical TCA cycle and is likely to occur in a wide range of anaerobic microorganisms.

Biological inorganic carbon fixation proceeds through a number of fundamentally different autotrophic pathways that are defined by specific key enzymatic reactions. Detection of the enzymatic genes in (meta)genomes is widely used to estimate the contribution of individual organisms or communities to primary production. Here we show that the sulfur-reducing anaerobic deltaproteobacterium Desulfurella acetivorans is capable of both acetate oxidation and autotrophic carbon fixation, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle operating either in the oxidative or reductive direction, respectively. Under autotrophic conditions, the enzyme citrate synthase cleaves citrate adenosine triphosphate independently into acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate, a reaction that has been regarded as impossible under physiological conditions. Because this overlooked, energetically efficient carbon fixation pathway lacks key enzymes, it may function unnoticed in many organisms, making bioinformatical predictions difficult, if not impossible.
Classical biochemistry reveals the occurrence of an unexpected capacity to reverse the tricarboxylic acid cycle in anaerobic microbes.

	abstract = {Bacteria and other cells show a puzzling behavior. At high growth rates, E. coli switch from respiration (which is ATP-efficient) to using fermentation for additional ATP (which is inefficient). This overflow metabolism results in a several-fold decrease in ATP produced per glucose molecule provided as food. By integrating diverse types of experimental data into a simple biophysical model, we give evidence that this onset is the result of the membrane real estate hypothesis: Fast growth drives cells to be bigger, reducing their surface-to-volume ratios. This decreases the membrane area available for respiratory proteins despite growing demand, causing increased crowding. Only when respiratory proteins reach their crowding limit does the cell activate fermentation, since fermentation allows faster ATP production per unit membrane area. Surface limitation thus creates a Pareto trade-off between membrane efficiency and ATP yield that links metabolic choice to the size and shape of a bacterial cell. By exploring the predictions that emerge from this trade-off, we show how consideration of molecular structures, energetics, rates, and equilibria can provide important insight into cellular behavior.},

Cellular homeostasis is regulated by signals through multiple molecular networks that include protein phosphorylation and metabolites. However, where and when the signal flows through a network and regulates homeostasis has not been explored. We have developed a reconstruction method for the signal flow based on time-course phosphoproteome and metabolome data, using multiple databases, and have applied it to acute action of insulin, an important hormone for metabolic homeostasis. An insulin signal flows through a network, through signaling pathways that involve 13 protein kinases, 26 phosphorylated metabolic enzymes, and 35 allosteric effectors, resulting in quantitative changes in 44 metabolites. Analysis of the network reveals that insulin induces phosphorylation and activation of liver-type phosphofructokinase 1, thereby controlling a key reaction in glycolysis. We thus provide a versatile method of reconstruction of signal flow through the network using phosphoproteome and metabolome data.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was chosen for sequencing because the few mutations it carries (ilvG rfb-50 rph-1) were considered innocuous. However, it has a number of growth defects. Internal pyrimidine starvation due to polarity of the rph-1 allele on pyrE was problematic in continuous culture. Moreover, the isolate of MG1655 obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center also carries a large deletion around the fnr (fumarate-nitrate respiration) regulatory gene. Although studies on DNA microarrays revealed apparent cross-regulation of gene expression between galactose and lactose metabolism in the Stock Center isolate of MG1655, this was due to the occurrence of mutations that increased lacY expression and suppressed slow growth on galactose. The explanation for apparent cross-regulation between galactose and N-acetylglucosamine metabolism was similar. By contrast, cross-regulation between lactose and maltose metabolism appeared to be due to generation of internal maltosaccharides in lactose-grown cells and may be physiologically significant. Lactose is of restricted distribution: it is normally found together with maltosaccharides, which are starch degradation products, in the mammalian intestine. Strains designated MG1655 and obtained from other sources differed from the Stock Center isolate and each other in several respects. We confirmed that use of other E. coli strains with MG1655-based DNA microarrays works well, and hence these arrays can be used to study any strain of interest. The responses to nitrogen limitation of two urinary tract isolates and an intestinal commensal strain isolated recently from humans were remarkably similar to those of MG1655.},

One key target for improving crop productivity and yields is increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. Central to photosynthesis is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco, which is a critical but often rate-limiting component. Here we present full Rubisco catalytic properties measured at three temperatures for 75 plants species representing both crops and undomesticated plants from diverse climates. Some newly characterised Rubiscos were naturally 'better' compared to crop enzymes and have the potential to improve crop photosynthetic efficiency. The temperature response of the various catalytic parameters was largely consistent across the diverse range of species, though absolute values showed significant variation in Rubisco catalysis, even between closely related species. An analysis of residue differences amongst the species characterised identified a number of candidate amino acid substitutions that will aid in advancing engineering of improved Rubisco in crop systems. This study provides new insights on the range of Rubisco catalysis and temperature response present in nature, and provides new information to include in models from leaf to canopy and ecosystem scale.},

	abstract = {While marine phytoplankton rival plants in their contribution to global primary productivity, our understanding of their photosynthesis remains rudimentary. In particular, the kinetic diversity of the CO2-fixing enzyme, Rubisco, in phytoplankton remains unknown. Here we quantify the maximum rates of carboxylation (kcatc), oxygenation (kcato), Michaelis constants (Km) for CO2 (KC) and O2 (KO), and specificity for CO2 over O2 (SC/O) for Form I Rubisco from 11 diatom species. Diatom Rubisco shows greater variation in KC (23–68 µM), SC/O (57–116mol mol−1), and KO (413–2032 µM) relative to plant and algal Rubisco. The broad range of KC values mostly exceed those of C4 plant Rubisco, suggesting that the strength of the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in diatoms is more diverse, and more effective than previously predicted. The measured kcatc for each diatom Rubisco showed less variation (2.1–3.7s−1), thus averting the canonical trade-off typically observed between KC and kcatc for plant Form I Rubisco. Uniquely, a negative relationship between KC and cellular Rubisco content was found, suggesting variation among diatom species in how they allocate their limited cellular resources between Rubisco synthesis and their CCM. The activation status of Rubisco in each diatom was low, indicating a requirement for Rubisco activase. This work highlights the need to better understand the correlative natural diversity between the Rubisco kinetics and CCM of diatoms and the underpinning mechanistic differences in catalytic chemistry among the Form I Rubisco superfamily.},

Hence, they play a role in maintaining metabolic flexibility in E. coli whenever this organism has to adapt to conditions with changing redox characteristics, such as oxygen availability. Here, the authors report on the changes in both the size and the redox state of the quinone pool when the environment changes from being well aerated to one with low oxygen availability. It is shown that such transitions are accompanied by a rapid increase in the demethylmenaquinone pool, and a slow increase in the MK pool. Moreover, in exponentially growing cultures in a well-shaken Erlenmeyer flask, it is observed that the assumption of a pseudo-steady state does not hold with respect to the redox state of the quinone pool.},

Although much is known about E. coli gene expression and metabolism under fully aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the intermediate oxygen tensions that are encountered in natural niches are understudied. Here, for the first time, the transcript profiles of E. coli K-12 across the physiologically significant range of oxygen availabilities are described. These suggested a progressive switch to aerobic respiratory metabolism and a remodeling of the cell envelope as oxygen availability increased. The transcriptional responses were consistent with changes in the abundance of cytochrome bd and bo′ and the outer membrane protein OmpW. The observed transcript and protein profiles result from changes in the activities of regulators that respond to oxygen itself or to metabolic and environmental signals that are sensitive to oxygen availability (aerobiosis). A probabilistic model (TFInfer) was used to predict the activity of the indirect oxygen-sensing two-component system ArcBA across the aerobiosis range. The model implied that the activity of the regulator ArcA correlated with aerobiosis but not with the redox state of the ubiquinone pool, challenging the idea that ArcA activity is inhibited by oxidized ubiquinone. The amount of phosphorylated ArcA correlated with the predicted ArcA activities and with aerobiosis, suggesting that fermentation product-mediated inhibition of ArcB phosphatase activity is the dominant mechanism for regulating ArcA activity under the conditions used here.},

	abstract = {Most industrial production processes are performed in fed-batch operational mode. In contrast, the screenings for microbial production strains are run in batch mode which results in completely different physiological conditions than relevant for production conditions. This may lead to wrong selections of strains. Silicone elastomer discs containing glucose crystals were developed to realize fed-batch fermentation in shake flasks. No other device for feeding was required. Glucose was fed in this way to Hansenula polymorpha cultures controlled by diffusion. Two strains of H. polymorpha were investigated in shake flasks: the wild-type strain (DSM 70277) and a recombinant strain pC10-FMD (PFMD-GFP). The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) of the cultures were monitored online in shake flasks with a Respiration Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS). Formation of biomass and green fluorescent protein (GFP), pH-drift and the metabolite dynamics of glucose, ethanol and acetic acid were measured offline. With the slow-release technique overflow metabolism could be reduced leading to an increase of 85\% in biomass yield. To date, 23.4 g/L cell dry weight of H. polymorpha could be achieved in shake flask. Biomass yields of 0.38–0.47 were obtained which are in the same magnitude of laboratory scale fermentors equipped with a substrate feed pump. GFP yield could be increased by a factor of 35 in Syn6-MES mineral medium. In fed-batch mode 88 mg/L GFP was synthesized with 35.9 g/L fed glucose. In contrast, only 2.5 mg/L with 40 g/L metabolized glucose was revealed in batch mode. In YNB mineral medium over 420-fold improvement in fed-batch mode was achieved with 421 mg/L GFP at 41.3 g/L fed glucose in comparison to less than 1 mg/L in batch mode with 40 g/L glucose. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the textbook portrayal of glycolysis as a single pathway conserved across all domains of life, not all sugar-consuming organisms use the canonical Embden–Meyerhoff–Parnass (EMP) glycolytic pathway. Prokaryotic glucose metabolism is particularly diverse, including several alternative glycolytic pathways, the most common of which is the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The prevalence of the ED pathway is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per glucose—half as much as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of prokaryotic glucose metabolism may reflect a tradeoff between a pathway’s energy (ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required to catalyze pathway flux. We introduce methods for analyzing pathways in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics and show that the ED pathway is expected to require several-fold less enzymatic protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that prokaryotes use different glycolytic pathways depending on their energy supply. Specifically, energy-deprived anaerobes overwhelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the EMP pathway, whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how protein costs can explain the use of alternative metabolic strategies, this study illustrates a direct connection between an organism’s environment and the thermodynamic and biochemical properties of the metabolic pathways it employs.},

	abstract = {Tradeoffs provide a rationale for the outcome of natural selection. A prominent example is the negative correlation between the growth rate and the biomass yield in unicellular organisms. This tradeoff leads to a dilemma, where the optimization of growth rate is advantageous for an individual, whereas the optimization of the biomass yield would be advantageous for a population. High-rate strategies are observed in a broad variety of organisms such as Escherichia coli, yeast, and cancer cells. Growth in suspension cultures favors fast-growing organisms, whereas spatial structure is of importance for the evolution of high-yield strategies. Despite this realization, experimental methods to directly select for increased yield are lacking. We here show that the serial propagation of a microbial population in a water-in-oil emulsion allows selection of strains with increased biomass yield. The propagation in emulsion creates a spatially structured environment where the growth-limiting substrate is privatized for populations founded by individual cells. Experimental evolution of several isogenic Lactococcus lactis strains demonstrated the existence of a tradeoff between growth rate and biomass yield as an apparent Pareto front. The underlying mutations altered glucose transport and led to major shifts between homofermentative and heterofermentative metabolism, accounting for the changes in metabolic efficiency. The results demonstrated the impact of privatizing a public good on the evolutionary outcome between competing metabolic strategies. The presented approach allows the investigation of fundamental questions in biology such as the evolution of cooperation, cell–cell interactions, and the relationships between environmental and metabolic constraints.},

We tested this premise in Lactococcus lactis, a bacterium that exhibits a distinct, anaerobic version of the bacterial Crabtree/Warburg effect; with increasing growth rates it shifts from a high yield metabolic mode [mixed-acid fermentation; 3 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per glucose] to a low yield metabolic mode (homolactic fermentation; 2 ATP per glucose). We studied growth rate-dependent relative transcription and protein ratios, enzyme activities, and fluxes of L. lactis in glucose-limited chemostats, providing a high-quality and comprehensive data set. A three- to fourfold higher growth rate rerouted metabolism from acetate to lactate as the main fermentation product. However, we observed hardly any changes in transcription, protein levels and enzyme activities. Even levels of ribosomal proteins, constituting a major investment in cellular machinery, changed only slightly. Thus, contrary to the original hypothesis, central metabolism in this organism appears to be hardly regulated at the level of gene expression, but rather at the metabolic level. We conclude that L. lactis is either poorly adapted to growth at low and constant glucose concentrations, or that protein costs play a less important role in fitness than hitherto assumed.},

	abstract = {As a major contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it has been suggested that reducing animal agriculture or consumption of animal-derived foods may reduce GHGs and enhance food security. Because the total removal of animals provides the extreme boundary to potential mitigation options and requires the fewest assumptions to model, the yearly nutritional and GHG impacts of eliminating animals from US agriculture were quantified. Animal-derived foods currently provide energy (24\% of total), protein (48\%), essential fatty acids (23–100\%), and essential amino acids (34–67\%) available for human consumption in the United States. The US livestock industry employs 1.6 × 106 people and accounts for \$31.8 billion in exports. Livestock recycle more than 43.2 × 109 kg of human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts, converting them into human-edible food, pet food, industrial products, and 4 × 109 kg of N fertilizer. Although modeled plants-only agriculture produced 23\% more food, it met fewer of the US population’s requirements for essential nutrients. When nutritional adequacy was evaluated by using least-cost diets produced from foods available, more nutrient deficiencies, a greater excess of energy, and a need to consume a greater amount of food solids were encountered in plants-only diets. In the simulated system with no animals, estimated agricultural GHG decreased (28\%), but did not fully counterbalance the animal contribution of GHG (49\% in this model). This assessment suggests that removing animals from US agriculture would reduce agricultural GHG emissions, but would also create a food supply incapable of supporting the US population’s nutritional requirements.},

Cellular metabolism, for example, typically involves hundreds of enzymes and metabolites, but it is unclear according to which principles their concentrations are set. Reasoning that natural selection will drive cells towards achieving a given physiological state at minimal cost, we derive a general equation that predicts the concentration of a metabolite from the concentration of the most abundant and costly enzyme consuming it. Simulations of cellular growth as well as experimental data demonstrate that costs are approximately proportional to molecular masses. For effectively irreversible reactions, the cell maximizes its metabolic efficiency by investing equally into substrate and unbound enzyme molecules. Without fitting any free parameters, the resulting model predicts in vivo substrate concentrations from enzyme concentrations and substrate affinities with high accuracy across data from E. coli and diverse eukaryotes (R{\textasciicircum}2=0.79, geometric mean fold-error 1.74). The corresponding organizing principle - the minimization of the summed mass concentrations of solutes - may facilitate reducing the complexity of kinetic models and will contribute to the design of more efficient synthetic cellular systems.},

Here, we developed a temporal‐fluxomics approach to derive a comprehensive and quantitative view of alterations in metabolic fluxes throughout the mammalian cell cycle. This is achieved by combining pulse‐chase LC‐MS‐based isotope tracing in synchronized cell populations with computational deconvolution and metabolic flux modeling. We find that TCA cycle fluxes are rewired as cells progress through the cell cycle with complementary oscillations of glucose versus glutamine‐derived fluxes: Oxidation of glucose‐derived flux peaks in late G1 phase, while oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism dominates S phase. These complementary flux oscillations maintain a constant production rate of reducing equivalents and oxidative phosphorylation flux throughout the cell cycle.

	abstract = {In previous work, we constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain for microbial production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which has applications in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. In this work, we improve GlcNAc production through modular engineering of B. subtilis. Specifically, the GlcNAc synthesis-related metabolic network in B. subtilis was divided into three modules—GlcNAc synthesis, glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis. First, two-promoter systems with different promoter types and strengths were used for combinatorial assembly of expression cassettes of glmS (encoding GlcN-6-phosphate synthase) and GNA1 (encoding GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) at transcriptional levels in the GlcNAc synthesis module, resulting in a 32.4\% increase in GlcNAc titer (from 1.85g/L to 2.45g/L) in shake flasks. In addition, lactate and acetate synthesis were blocked by knockout of ldh (encoding lactate dehydrogenase) and pta (encoding phosphotransacetylase), leading to a 44.9\% increase in GlcNAc production (from 2.45g/L to 3.55g/L) in shake flasks. Then, various strengths of the glycolysis and peptidoglycan synthesis modules were constructed by repressing the expression of pfk (encoding 6-phosphofructokinase) and glmM (encoding phosphoglucosamine mutase) via the expression of various combinations of synthetic small regulatory RNAs and Hfq protein. Next, GlcNAc, glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis modules with various strengths were assembled and optimized via a module engineering approach, and the GlcNAc titer was improved to 8.30g/L from 3.55g/L in shake flasks. Finally, the GlcNAc titer was further increased to 31.65g/L, which was 3.8-fold that in the shake flask, in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor. This work significantly enhanced GlcNAc production through modular pathway engineering of B. subtilis, and the engineering strategies used herein may be useful for the construction of versatile B. subtilis cell factories for the production of other industrially important chemicals.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the mechanisms of microbial adaptive evolution following genetic or environmental challenges is of fundamental interest in biological science and engineering. When the challenge is the loss of a metabolic enzyme, adaptive responses can also shed significant insight into metabolic robustness, regulation, and areas of kinetic limitation. In this study, whole-genome sequencing and high-resolution 13C-metabolic flux analysis were performed on 10 adaptively evolved pgi knockouts of Escherichia coli. Pgi catalyzes the first reaction in glycolysis, and its loss results in major physiological and carbon catabolism pathway changes, including an 80\% reduction in growth rate. Following adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), the knockouts increase their growth rate by up to 3.6-fold. Through combined genomic–fluxomic analysis, we characterized the mutations and resulting metabolic fluxes that enabled this fitness recovery. Large increases in pyridine cofactor transhydrogenase flux, correcting imbalanced production of NADPH and NADH, were enabled by direct mutations to the transhydrogenase genes sthA and pntAB. The phosphotransferase system component crr was also found to be frequently mutated, which corresponded to elevated flux from pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The overall energy metabolism was found to be strikingly robust, and what have been previously described as latently activated Entner–Doudoroff and glyoxylate shunt pathways are shown here to represent no real increases in absolute flux relative to the wild type. These results indicate that the dominant mechanism of adaptation was to relieve the rate-limiting steps in cofactor metabolism and substrate uptake and to modulate global transcriptional regulation from stress response to catabolism.},

Given its potential comprehensive coverage, untargeted metabolomics is often the first choice of experiments for investigators pursuing a metabolic research question. It is important to recognize, however, that untargeted metabolomics may not always be the optimal experimental approach. Conventionally, untargeted metabolomics only provides information about relative differences in metabolite pool sizes. Therefore, depending on the specific scientific question at hand, a complementary approach involving stable isotopes (such as metabolic flux analysis) may be better suited to provide biological insights.

These protein–protein interactions are of high relevance for many biological functions. In addition to many well established protein complexes an increasing number of protein–protein interactions, which form rather transient complexes has recently been discovered. The formation of such complexes seems to be a common feature especially for metabolic pathways. In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, we identified a protein complex of three citric acid cycle enzymes. This complex consists of the citrate synthase, the isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the malate dehydrogenase. Moreover, fumarase and aconitase interact with malate dehydrogenase and with each other. These five enzymes catalyze sequential reaction of the TCA cycle. Thus, this interaction might be important for a direct transfer of intermediates of the TCA cycle and thus for elevated metabolic fluxes via substrate channeling. In addition, we discovered a link between the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis through a flexible interaction of two proteins: the association between the malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is directly controlled by the metabolic flux. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase links the TCA cycle with gluconeogenesis and is essential for B. subtilis growing on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Only under gluconeogenic growth conditions an interaction of these two proteins is detectable and disappears under glycolytic growth conditions.},

	abstract = {What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10\% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70\% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13\% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.},

	abstract = {The inter-organelle cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells was once considered to be a homogeneous solution in which many of the enzymes of intermediary metabolism are soluble; however, advances in cell biology have revealed an intricate picture at the microscopic level of cytoplasm structure. Consequently, a great deal of constraint is required when extrapolating to the intact cell from enzyme studies in vitro, a point made frequently in the literature of the last decade or so. The idea of spatial organization is now accepted and covers a wide variety of local microenvironments and possibly localized metabolic channelling. The latter, although accepted as a phenomenon, is controversial in terms of its physiological significance. This review covers evidences showing that both glycolytic and glycogenolytic enzymes are microcompartmentalized. The potential significance of this compartmentation appears to involve metabolic chanelling, a process by which rearrangement of enzymes on a dynamic cytomatrix leads to “channels” in which metabolic substrates are passed from one enzyme to the next. The combined effects of such enzyme proximity and their activation as a result of the altered kinetic properties conferred upon the enzymes by their cytoskeletal associations favours maximal rate of reaction. These and other aspects of microcompartmentation and metabolic channelling are discussed.},

Here, using enzymatic assays, we show that all glycolytic enzymes are associated with mitochondria in yeast, to extents similar to those previously reported for Arabidopsis cells. Using separation of mitochondrial complexes by blue-native/SDS-PAGE and coimmunoprecipitation of mitochondrial proteins with anti-enolase antibodies, we found that enolase takes part in a large macromolecular complex associated to mitochondria. The identified components included additional glycolytic enzymes, mitochondrial membrane carriers, and enzymes of the TCA cycle. We suggest a possible role of the enolase complex in the channeling of pyruvate, the terminal product of glycolysis, towards the TCA cycle within mitochondria. Moreover, we show that the mitochondrial enolase-containing complex also contains the cytosolic tRNACUULys, which is mitochondrially-imported, and its presumed import carrier, the precursor of the mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetase. This suggests an unsuspected novel function for this complex in tRNA mitochondrial import.},

Nevertheless, it is governed by a strict set of rules that make it somewhat predictable and amenable to modeling. The laws of thermodynamics play a pivotal role by determining reaction feasibility and by governing the kinetics of enzymes. Here we introduce estimations for the standard Gibbs energy of reactions, with the best combination of accuracy and coverage to date. The estimations are derived using a new method which we denote component contribution. This method integrates multiple sources of information into a consistent framework that obeys the laws of thermodynamics, and provides a significant improvement in accuracy compared to previous genome-wide estimations of standard Gibbs energies. We apply and test our method on reconstructions of E. coli and human metabolism and, in addition, do our best to facilitate the use of these estimations in future models by providing open-source software that performs the integration in a streamlined process.},

	abstract = {Regulation of metabolic operation in response to extracellular cues is crucial for cells’ survival. Next to the canonical nutrient sensors, which measure the concentration of nutrients, recently intracellular “metabolic flux” was proposed as a novel impetus for metabolic regulation. According to this concept, cells would have molecular systems (“flux sensors”) in place that regulate metabolism as a function of the actually occurring metabolic fluxes. Although this resembles an appealing concept, we have not had any experimental evidence for the existence of flux sensors and also we have not known how these flux sensors would work in detail. Here, we show experimental evidence that supports the hypothesis that Escherichia coli is indeed able to measure its glycolytic flux and uses this signal for metabolic regulation. Combining experiment and theory, we show how this flux-sensing function could emerge from an aggregate of several molecular mechanisms: First, the system of reactions of lower glycolysis and the feedforward activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on pyruvate kinase translate flux information into the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The interaction of this “flux-signaling metabolite” with the transcription factor Cra then leads to flux-dependent regulation. By responding to glycolytic flux, rather than to the concentration of individual carbon sources, the cell may minimize sensing and regulatory expenses.},

It is known that many topologically feasible EFMs are biologically irrelevant. Therefore, tools are needed to find the relevant ones. We present thermodynamic tEFM analysis (tEFMA) which uses the cellular metabolome to avoid the enumeration of thermodynamically infeasible EFMs. Specifically, given a metabolic network and a not necessarily complete metabolome, tEFMA efficiently returns the full set of thermodynamically feasible EFMs consistent with the metabolome. Compared with standard approaches, tEFMA strongly reduces the memory consumption and the overall runtime. Thus tEFMA provides a new way to analyze unbiasedly hitherto inaccessible large-scale metabolic networks.Availability and implementation: https://github.com/mpgerstl/tEFMAContact: christian.jungreuthmayer@boku.ac.at or juergen.zanghellini@boku.ac.atSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {This first paper in a series investigates the problem of predicting and analysing the effects of large changes in enzyme activities or external nutrients/effectors on metabolic fluxes. We introduce the concept of a deviation index, D, which gives a measure of the relative change in a metabolic variable (e.g. flux) due to a large (non-infinitesimal) relative change in a parameter (e.g. enzyme). Using simplifying kinetic assumptions we have found, for an unbranched metabolic chain, a direct relationship between deviation indices and flux control coefficients. This relationship provides a method to estimate flux control coefficients using a single large change in enzyme activity. We also provide a method of predicting the effects of, for example, DNA manipulation or other techniques for enzyme activity/concentration changes on metabolic fluxes. Up-modulations of single enzymes rarely produce significant changes in fluxes. We show that combined changes of activity of a group of enzymes will produce a more than ‘additive’ response. We provide a method of predicting the effects of these combined changes, given either the flux control coefficients of the group of enzymes or the effects on the flux of changing the enzymes individually. A similar analysis is carried out for large changes in external nutrients or effectors. These amplification factors, f, give experimentally accessible estimates of the expected changes in metabolic variables. We provide three ‘case studies’ to illustrate our results.},

	abstract = {We extend the analysis of unbranched chains (preceding paper) to large parameter changes in branched systems using linear kinetic assumptions. More complex relationships between flux control coefficients and deviation indices are established. In particular, the deviation index in such systems depends on more than one control coefficient as well as on the magnitude of the enzyme change. Non-additivity of the indices is the general rule. Combined changes of groups of enzymes, whether co-ordinate or not, have also been formulated. Control coefficients can be estimated from a small number of independent large-change experiments. Alternatively, the amplification factors can be calculated given the knowledge of the control coefficients. A ‘case study’ using published data is presented. The movement of intermediate metabolites as a consequence of large parameter changes can be dealt with in a similar manner. Experimental methods for showing the admissibility of assuming the simplifying assumptions used are summarised. Some simulation studies show possible limits of the application of the approach and some aspects of the general, non-linear, case are discussed. It is concluded that, although metabolic systems are in principle non-linear, many behave, in practice, as quasi-linear systems. The relationships established between deviation indices and control coefficients therefore provide a practical way of predicting the effects of large-scale changes in parameters for many metabolic systems.},

Our analysis revealed the existence of four discrete groups of networks of increasing complexity, with transitions between groups being contingent on the presence of key metabolites, including molecular oxygen, which was required for transition into the largest networks.

	abstract = {Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is a widely-used method for improving the fitness of microorganisms in selected environmental conditions. It has been applied previously to Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 during aerobic exponential growth on glucose minimal media, a frequently used model organism and growth condition, to probe the limits of E. coli growth rate and gain insights into fast growth phenotypes. Previous studies have described up to 1.6-fold increases in growth rate following ALE, and have identified key causal genetic mutations and changes in transcriptional patterns. Here, we report for the first time intracellular metabolic fluxes for six such adaptively evolved strains, as determined by high-resolution 13C-metabolic flux analysis. Interestingly, we found that intracellular metabolic pathway usage changed very little following adaptive evolution. Instead, at the level of central carbon metabolism the faster growth was facilitated by proportional increases in glucose uptake and all intracellular rates. Of the six evolved strains studied here, only one strain showed a small degree of flux rewiring, and this was also the strain with unique genetic mutations. A comparison of fluxes with two other wild-type (unevolved) E. coli strains, BW25113 and BL21, showed that inter-strain differences are greater than differences between the parental and evolved strains. Principal component analysis highlighted that nearly all flux differences (95\%) between the nine strains were captured by only two principal components. The distance between measured and flux balance analysis predicted fluxes was also investigated. It suggested a relatively wide range of similar stoichiometric optima, which opens new questions about the path-dependency of adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {Growth kinetics, i.e., the relationship between specific growth rate and the concentration of a substrate, is one of the basic tools in microbiology. However, despite more than half a century of research, many fundamental questions about the validity and application of growth kinetics as observed in the laboratory to environmental growth conditions are still unanswered. For pure cultures growing with single substrates, enormous inconsistencies exist in the growth kinetic data reported. The low quality of experimental data has so far hampered the comparison and validation of the different growth models proposed, and only recently have data collected from nutrient-controlled chemostat cultures allowed us to compare different kinetic models on a statistical basis. The problems are mainly due to (i) the analytical difficulty in measuring substrates at growth-controlling concentrations and (ii) the fact that during a kinetic experiment, particularly in batch systems, microorganisms alter their kinetic properties because of adaptation to the changing environment. For example, for Escherichia coli growing with glucose, a physiological long-term adaptation results in a change in KS for glucose from some 5 mg liter−1 to ca. 30 μg liter−1. The data suggest that a dilemma exists, namely, that either “intrinsic” KS (under substrate-controlled conditions in chemostat culture) or μmax (under substrate-excess conditions in batch culture) can be measured but both cannot be determined at the same time. The above-described conventional growth kinetics derived from single-substrate-controlled laboratory experiments have invariably been used for describing both growth and substrate utilization in ecosystems. However, in nature, microbial cells are exposed to a wide spectrum of potential substrates, many of which they utilize simultaneously (in particular carbon sources). The kinetic data available to date for growth of pure cultures in carbon-controlled continuous culture with defined mixtures of two or more carbon sources (including pollutants) clearly demonstrate that simultaneous utilization results in lowered residual steady-state concentrations of all substrates. This should result in a competitive advantage of a cell capable of mixed-substrate growth because it can grow much faster at low substrate concentrations than one would expect from single-substrate kinetics. Additionally, the relevance of the kinetic principles obtained from defined culture systems with single, mixed, or multicomponent substrates to the kinetics of pollutant degradation as it occurs in the presence of alternative carbon sources in complex environmental systems is discussed. The presented overview indicates that many of the environmentally relevant apects in growth kinetics are still waiting to be discovered, established, and exploited.},

RuBisCo, the key enzyme of photosynthesis, is a complex of eight large and eight small subunits. It mediates the fixation of atmospheric CO2 in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. In addition to being enzymatically inefficient, RuBisCo has a problem with distinguishing between CO2 and O2. The fixation of O2 results in the energetically wasteful reaction of photorespiration. Thus, there is a strong incentive to improve RuBisCo's catalytic properties by engineering. However, for decades, it has been impossible to express the enzyme from plants in an easily manipulatable bacterial host. Aigner et al. succeeded in functionally expressing plant RuBisCo in Escherichia coli (see the Perspective by Yeates and Wheatley). This should allow for the systematic mutational analysis of RuBisCo and selection of favorable variants for improved crop yields.

Plant RuBisCo, a complex of eight large and eight small subunits, catalyzes the fixation of CO2 in photosynthesis. The low catalytic efficiency of RuBisCo provides strong motivation to reengineer the enzyme with the goal of increasing crop yields. However, genetic manipulation has been hampered by the failure to express plant RuBisCo in a bacterial host. We achieved the functional expression of Arabidopsis thaliana RuBisCo in Escherichia coli by coexpressing multiple chloroplast chaperones. These include the chaperonins Cpn60/Cpn20, RuBisCo accumulation factors 1 and 2, RbcX, and bundle-sheath defective-2 (BSD2). Our structural and functional analysis revealed the role of BSD2 in stabilizing an end-state assembly intermediate of eight RuBisCo large subunits until the small subunits become available. The ability to produce plant RuBisCo recombinantly will facilitate efforts to improve the enzyme through mutagenesis.
Success is finally achieved in the recombinant expression of functional plant RuBisCo.

	abstract = {The capacity of Escherichia coli to adapt its catabolism to prevailing redox conditions resides mainly in three catabolic branch points involving (i) pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), (ii) the exclusively fermentative enzymes and those of the Krebs cycle, and (iii) the alternative terminal cytochrome bd and cytochrome bo oxidases. A quantitative analysis of the relative catabolic fluxes through these pathways is presented for steady-state glucose-limited chemostat cultures with controlled oxygen availability ranging from full aerobiosis to complete anaerobiosis. Remarkably, PFL contributed significantly to the catabolic flux under microaerobic conditions and was found to be active simultaneously with PDHc and cytochrome bdoxidase-dependent respiration. The synthesis of PFL and cytochromebd oxidase was found to be maximal in the lower microaerobic range but not in a ΔArcA mutant, and we conclude that the Arc system is more active with respect to regulation of these two positively regulated operons during microaerobiosis than during anaerobiosis.},

Here, a quantitative definition for oxygen availability (perceived aerobiosis) is presented; the definition is based on a calibration with reference to the minimal oxygen supply rate needed for fully oxidative catabolism (i.e., complete conversion of the energy source to CO2 and water for glucose-limited conditions). This quantitative method is used to show how steady-state electron fluxes through the alternative cytochrome oxidases of Escherichia coli are distributed as a function of the extent of aerobiosis of glucose-limited chemostat cultures. At low oxygen availability the electron flux is mainly via the high-affinity cytochrome bd oxidase, and, at higher oxygen availability, a similar phenomenon occurs but now via the low-affinity cytochrome bo oxidase. The main finding is that the catabolic activities of E. coli (and specifically its respiratory activity) are affected by the actual oxygen availability per unit of biomass rather than by the residual dissolved oxygen concentration of the culture.},

Specifically, we applied 13C-tracers and evaluated 25 different co-substrates for methanol assimilation, including amino acids, sugars and organic acids. In particular, co-utilization of threonine significantly enhanced methylotrophy. Through our investigations, we proposed specific metabolic pathways that, when activated, correlated with increased methanol assimilation. These pathways are normally repressed by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (lrp), a global regulator of metabolism associated with the feast-or-famine response in E. coli. By deleting lrp, we were able to further enhance the methylotrophic ability of our synthetic strain, as demonstrated through increased incorporation of 13C carbon from 13C-methanol into biomass.},

	abstract = {Microbes in fragmented environments profit from yield-efficient metabolic strategies, which allow for a maximal number of cells. In contrast, cells in well-mixed, nutrient-rich environments need to grow and divide fast to out-compete others. Paradoxically, a fast growth can entail wasteful, yield-inefficient modes of metabolism and smaller cell numbers. Therefore, general trade-offs between biomass yield and growth rate have been hypothesized. To study the conditions for such rate/yield trade-offs, we considered a kinetic model of E. coli central metabolism and determined flux distributions that provide maximal growth rates or maximal biomass yields. Maximal growth rates or yields are achieved by sparse flux distributions called elementary flux modes (EFMs). By implementing a framework we call Flux-analysis Enzyme Cost Minimization (fECM), we screened all EFMs in the network model and computed the biomass yields and the minimal amount of protein requirements, which we then use to estimate the growth rates. In a scatter plot between the growth rates and yields of all EFMs, a trade-off shows up as a Pareto front. At reference glucose and oxygen levels, we find that the rate/yield trade-off is small. However, in low-oxygen environments, a much clearer trade-off emerges: low-yield fermentation EFMs allow for a growth 2-3 times faster than the maximal- yield EFM. The trade-off is therefore strongly condition-dependent and should be almost unnoticeable at high oxygen and glucose levels, the typical conditions in laboratory experiments. Our public web service www.neos-guide.org/content/enzyme-cost-minimization allows users to run fECM to compute enzyme costs for metabolic models of their choice.},

For many constraint-based models, FVA identifies unboundedness of the optimal flux space. This reveals that optimal flux solutions with net flux through internal biochemical loops are feasible, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Such unbounded fluxes may be eliminated by extending FVA with thermodynamic constraints.Results: We present a new algorithm for efficient flux variability (and flux balance) analysis with thermodynamic constraints, suitable for analysing genome-scale metabolic networks. We first show that FBA with thermodynamic constraints is NP-hard. Then we derive a theoretical tractability result, which can be applied to metabolic networks in practice. We use this result to develop a new constraint programming algorithm Fast-tFVA for fast FVA with thermodynamic constraints (tFVA). Computational comparisons with previous methods demonstrate the efficiency of the new method. For tFVA, a speed-up of factor 30–300 is achieved. In an analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks in the BioModels database, we found that in 485 of 716 networks, additional irreversible or fixed reactions could be detected.Availability and implementation:Fast-tFVA is written in C++ and published under GPL.

	abstract = {Motivation: Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using ‘loopless constraints’. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models.Results: We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm—Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)—inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible ‘loop-law’ matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.Availability and Implementation: Source code for MATLAB including examples is freely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under Software.

Network‐embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model‐based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub‐omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell‐averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.
Visual Overview
SynopsisSystems biology strives to gain a quantitative genome‐scale understanding of the complex and highly interrelated cellular processes and phenomena. Such in‐depth understanding will ultimately be achieved by a tight interplay between the two prominent pillars of systems biology: mathematical models and omics data. In the context of the latter, owing to the recent development of affordable and powerful mass spectrometers, large‐scale sets of quantitative metabolome data are currently complementing our data pool (Goodacre et al, 2004; Nielsen and Oliver, 2005).In order to fully exploit the wealth of information contained in large‐scale data sets and to convert data into a body of knowledge, integration into mathematical models is required. For quantitative metabolome data, kinetic models describing enzyme reaction rates would represent the natural way for computational analysis. However, because of the lack of comprehensive knowledge about in vivo reaction mechanisms and parameters, and the still existing challenges on the measurement side as well as on the computational analysis side, it is very unlikely that large‐scale kinetic models will become available in the near future. Until today, large‐scale sets of quantitative metabolome data cannot be assimilated into mathematical models (Nielsen and Oliver, 2005) and thus, insight, for instance into underlying regulatory mechanisms, can hardly be inferred.In this work, we present a computational thermodynamics‐based framework for the analysis of quantitative metabolome data, whereby the mapping onto a stoichiometric reaction network and a coupling to fluxome data allow for extraction of novel insight from the data without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling. More specifically, in the developed network‐embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis), experimentally determined intracellular fluxes and metabolite concentrations are coupled to each other via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites’ Gibbs energies of formation, whereas an optimization algorithm is employed to resolve network‐constrained, feasible ranges of Gibbs energies of reaction along with feasible ranges of unmeasured concentrations (Figure 1).We first examined a small set of measured metabolite concentrations obtained from an Escherichia coli chemostat culture to illustrate the concept and the application of NET analysis and to demonstrate its ability to extract insight from even limited metabolite data. First, we showed that NET analysis could serve as a tool to check thermodynamic consistency of a data set. Thermodynamic consistency was approved for the analyzed data set, although several other published data sets were found to be infeasible, which emphasizes the need for quality analyses of metabolome data before they enter databases or are used in modeling efforts.In a next step, we investigated whether NET analysis could also be used for prediction of unmeasured metabolite concentrations. In the analyzed data set, besides a few measured metabolites, the measurement provided only pooled concentrations for several isobaric molecules. With NET analysis, it was possible to resolve narrow concentration ranges for the individual metabolites. Moreover, concentration ranges were also predicted for some unmeasured metabolites. It can be envisioned that this predictive capability of NET analysis will support the development of more efficient analytical methods, as computable concentrations do not need to be determined experimentally.Measured metabolite concentrations hardly provide any insights into the organization of metabolism, that is, the regulatory structure responsible for routing of matter via the different metabolic pathways, the result of which is a certain intracellular flux distribution. A flux distribution is established by the fact that in comparison with the neighboring reactions, the rates of some reactions, are limited by the available catalytic activity, so that at branch points, mass flux is accordingly distributed into the possible pathways. A limited catalytic activity of a reaction manifests itself in a large Gibbs energy of reaction. Reactions operating far from equilibrium are more likely to impose flux control (Wang et al, 2004), and it is assumed that such reactions are more likely to be regulated by the cell (Crabtree et al, 1997).With NET analysis, reactions under putative active genetic or allosteric regulation can be identified from (even incomplete) metabolome data. For the data considered here, the respective results are provided in Figure 4. In perfect agreement with earlier findings, the pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase reactions were identified as regulatory sites in glycolysis, and also most other findings comply with our current knowledge, indicating that NET analysis of metabolome data is indeed able to provide correct regulatory insight.Another finding, exemplifying the method's ability to uncover unknown functional relationships in the metabolic network, is related to E. coli's cytoplasmic transhydrogenase (udh): in glucose‐limited continuous cultivations, compared to the biosynthetic demands, an excess of NADPH is produced (Nanchen et al, 2006). In order to eliminate excess NADPH, the udh‐transhydrogenase reaction converts NADPH into NADH. In the considered experiment, NET analysis revealed that this reaction operates far from equilibrium, indicating that it is subject to active regulation. Furthermore, we found that a regulatory control of the udh‐transhydrogenase is indeed required for physiological reasons: a further equilibration of the reactants, corresponding to a shift of the NAD(H) pool to the reduced state, would render the normal operation of catabolic (i.e. NAD‐dependent) dehydrogenases infeasible.Finally, we tested whether our approach is also applicable to more complex systems such as organisms with subcellular structure. For this, we extended the method and analyzed the largest available quantitative data set from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also here, after having approved thermodynamic consistency of the employed data set, we were able to identify active regulatory sites, consistent with our current knowledge. Furthermore, it was found that NET analysis can also be used to infer compartmental differences from cell‐averaged metabolome data: operational differences between reactions occurring in various compartments could be uncovered and even intracompartmental concentrations for a series of metabolites could be resolved.In summary, to gain insight from quantitative metabolome data, a coupling to mechanistic models is required. As an integrative analysis with kinetic models will remain a major challenge at least in the near future, we presented a new methodology (NET analysis) for the model‐based analysis of quantitative metabolite data. NET analysis is easy to apply, perfectly scalable to the systems level and it only relies on indisputable thermodynamic facts. Thus, besides being an instrument for quality assessment, the NET analysis’ capability to identify putative regulatory sites, to unravel interrelations between different parts of metabolisms and to resolve metabolic functionalities based on compartmentalization underpins its power for uncovering system properties from quantitative metabolome data. We envision that NET analysis will significantly assist systems biology research and also will support more applied fields such as metabolic engineering.
We present network‐embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) as computational framework to decipher insights from quantitative metabolome data.As exemplified with an E. coli data set, NET analysis showed to be a valuable tool to systematically test metabolite data for thermodynamic consistency, to predict concentrations of non‐measured metabolites and to identify metabolic reactions that are most likely subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation.Beyond, using cell‐averaged metabolome data from S. cerevisiae (as a representative for more complex organisms with subcellular structures), we demonstrate that NET analysis is also capable to computationally resolve intracompartmental metabolite concentrations and to unravel functional relationships that rely on compartmentation.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The expression of genes is controlled by specific
  combinations of cellular variables. We applied Independent Component
  Analysis (ICA) to gene expression data, deriving a linear model
  based on hidden variables, which we term ‘expression
  modes’. The expression of each gene is a linear function of
  the expression modes, where, according to the ICA model, the linear
  influences of different modes show a minimal statistical dependence,
  and their distributions deviate sharply from the normal
  distribution.Results: Studying cell cycle-related gene expression in yeast, we
  found that the dominant expression modes could be related to
  distinct biological functions, such as phases of the cell cycle or
  the mating response. Analysis of human lymphocytes revealed modes
  that were related to characteristic differences between cell types.
  With both data sets, the linear influences of the dominant modes
  showed distributions with large tails, indicating the existence of
  specifically up- and downregulated target genes. The expression
  modes and their influences can be used to visualize the samples and
  genes in low-dimensional spaces. A projection to expression modes
  helps to highlight particular biological functions, to reduce noise,
  and to compress the data in a biologically sensible way.Availability: The FastICA algorithm

	abstract = {Summary
Escherichia coli strains are widely used in academic research and biotechnology. New technologies for quantifying strain-specific differences and their underlying contributing factors promise greater understanding of how these differences significantly impact physiology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and process design. Here, we quantified strain-specific differences in seven widely used strains of E. coli (BL21, C, Crooks, DH5a, K-12 MG1655, K-12 W3110, and W) using genomics, phenomics, transcriptomics, and genome-scale modeling. Metabolic physiology and gene expression varied widely with downstream implications for productivity, product yield, and titer. These differences could be linked to differential regulatory structure. Analyzing high-flux reactions and expression of encoding genes resulted in a correlated and quantitative link between these sets, with strain-specific caveats. Integrated modeling revealed that certain strains are better suited to produce given compounds or express desired constructs considering native expression states of pathways that enable high-production phenotypes. This study yields a framework for quantitatively comparing strains in a species with implications for strain selection.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism were constructed for 55 fully sequenced Escherichia coli and Shigella strains. The GEMs enable a systems approach to characterizing the pan and core metabolic capabilities of the E. coli species. The majority of pan metabolic content was found to consist of alternate catabolic pathways for unique nutrient sources. The GEMs were then used to systematically analyze growth capabilities in more than 650 different growth-supporting environments. The results show that unique strain-specific metabolic capabilities correspond to pathotypes and environmental niches. Twelve of the GEMs were used to predict growth on six differentiating nutrients, and the predictions were found to agree with 80\% of experimental outcomes. Additionally, GEMs were used to predict strain-specific auxotrophies. Twelve of the strains modeled were predicted to be auxotrophic for vitamins niacin (vitamin B3), thiamin (vitamin B1), or folate (vitamin B9). Six of the strains modeled have lost biosynthetic pathways for essential amino acids methionine, tryptophan, or leucine. Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be used to define the metabolic essence of a microbial species and delineate growth differences that shed light on the adaptation process to a particular microenvironment.},

	abstract = {The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer programming approach called loopless COBRA (ll-COBRA), which can be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve flux predictions on three common COBRA methods: flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of loop-law constraints with ll-COBRA improves the consistency of simulation results with experimental data. This method provides an additional constraint for many COBRA methods, enabling the acquisition of more realistic simulation results.},

	abstract = {A new form of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) called thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA produces flux distributions that do not contain any thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it provides information about the free energy change of reactions and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change, ΔrG′, of the reactions and the activities of the metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction ΔrG′ are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a ΔrG′ constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified throughout metabolism for which ΔrG′ is always highly negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative ΔrG′ might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and Hextracellular+/Hintracellular+ are also determined and found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio and maximum feasible ratio, respectively.},

Here, we developed the anoxygenic phototroph, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, as a biocatalyst capable of light-driven CO2 reduction to CH4 in vivo using this remodeled nitrogenase. Conversion of CO2 to CH4 by R. palustris required constitutive expression of nitrogenase, which was achieved by using a variant of the transcription factor NifA that is able to activate expression of nitrogenase under all growth conditions. Also, light was required for generation of ATP by cyclic photophosphorylation. CH4 production by R. palustris could be controlled by manipulating the distribution of electrons and energy available to nitrogenase.

This process is shown here to introduce a paramagnetic moiety into the structure of pyruvate formate-lyase. It displays an EPR signal at g = 2 with a doublet splitting of 1.5 mT and could comprise an organic free radical located on an amino acid residue of the polypeptide chain. Hypophosphite was discovered as a specific reagent that destroys both the enzyme radical and the enzyme activity; it becomes covalently bound to the protein. The enzymatic generation of the radical, which is linked to adenosylmethionine cleavage into 5'-deoxyadenosine and methionine, possibly occurs through an Fe-adenosyl complex.

Complex sample preparation and analytical procedures render exact quantification extremely difficult. Furthermore, not only the actual measurement but also the subsequent interpretation of quantitative metabolome data to obtain mechanistic insights is still lacking behind the current expectations. Recently, the method of network-embedded thermodynamic (NET) analysis was introduced to address some of these open issues. Building upon principles of thermodynamics, this method allows for a quality check of measured metabolite concentrations and enables to spot metabolic reactions where active regulation potentially controls metabolic flux. So far, however, widespread application of NET analysis in metabolomics labs was hindered by the absence of suitable software.},

	abstract = {According to the most prevalent notion, changes in cellular physiology primarily occur in response to altered environmental conditions. Yet, recent studies have shown that changes in metabolic fluxes can also trigger phenotypic changes even when environmental conditions are unchanged. This suggests that cells have mechanisms in place to assess the magnitude of metabolic fluxes, that is, the rate of metabolic reactions, and use this information to regulate their physiology. In this review, we describe recent evidence for metabolic flux-sensing and flux-dependent regulation. Furthermore, we discuss how such sensing and regulation can be mechanistically achieved and present a set of new candidates for flux-signaling metabolites. Similar to metabolic-flux sensing, we argue that cells can also sense protein translation flux. Finally, we elaborate on the advantages that flux-based regulation can confer to cells.},

	abstract = {The kinetic parameters of enzymes are key to understanding the rate and specificity of most biological processes. Although specific trends are frequently studied for individual enzymes, global trends are rarely addressed. We performed an analysis of kcat and KM values of several thousand enzymes collected from the literature. We found that the “average enzyme” exhibits a kcat of ∼10 s–1 and a kcat/KM of ∼105 s–1 M–1, much below the diffusion limit and the characteristic textbook portrayal of kinetically superior enzymes. Why do most enzymes exhibit moderate catalytic efficiencies? Maximal rates may not evolve in cases where weaker selection pressures are expected. We find, for example, that enzymes operating in secondary metabolism are, on average, ∼30-fold slower than those of central metabolism. We also find indications that the physicochemical properties of substrates affect the kinetic parameters. Specifically, low molecular mass and hydrophobicity appear to limit KM optimization. In accordance, substitution with phosphate, CoA, or other large modifiers considerably lowers the KM values of enzymes utilizing the substituted substrates. It therefore appears that both evolutionary selection pressures and physicochemical constraints shape the kinetic parameters of enzymes. It also seems likely that the catalytic efficiency of some enzymes toward their natural substrates could be increased in many cases by natural or laboratory evolution.},

	abstract = {Chemical reaction systems operating in nonequilibrium open-system states arise in a great number of contexts, including the study of living organisms, in which chemical reactions, in general, are far from equilibrium. Here we introduce a theorem that relates forward and reverse fluxes and free energy for any chemical process operating in a steady state. This relationship, which is a generalization of equilibrium conditions to the case of a chemical process occurring in a nonequilibrium steady state in dilute solution, provides a novel equivalent definition for chemical reaction free energy. In addition, it is shown that previously unrelated theories introduced by Ussing and Hodgkin and Huxley for transport of ions across membranes, Hill for catalytic cycle fluxes, and Crooks for entropy production in microscopically reversible systems, are united in a common framework based on this relationship.},

	abstract = {The assimilation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic material is quantitatively the most important biosynthetic process. We discovered that an autotrophic member of the archaeal order Sulfolobales, Metallosphaera sedula, fixed CO2 with acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)/propionyl-CoA carboxylase as the key carboxylating enzyme. In this system, one acetyl-CoA and two bicarbonate molecules were reductively converted via 3-hydroxypropionate to succinyl-CoA. This intermediate was reduced to 4-hydroxybutyrate and converted into two acetyl-CoA molecules via 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase. The key genes of this pathway were found not only in Metallosphaera but also in Sulfolobus, Archaeoglobus, and Cenarchaeum species. Moreover, the Global Ocean Sampling database contains half as many 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase sequences as compared with those found for another key photosynthetic CO2-fixing enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase. This indicates the importance of this enzyme in global carbon cycling.},

	abstract = {Plants with the C photosynthetic pathway dominate today's tropical savannahs and grasslands, and account for some 30\% of global terrestrial carbon fixation. Their success stems from a physiological CO-concentrating pump, which leads to high photosynthetic efficiency in warm climates and low atmospheric CO concentrations. Remarkably, their dominance of tropical environments was achieved in only the past 10 million years (Myr), less than 3\% of the time that terrestrial plants have existed on Earth. We critically review the proposal that declining atmospheric CO triggered this tropical revolution via its effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves. Our synthesis of the latest geological evidence from South Asia and North America suggests that this emphasis is misplaced. Instead, we find important roles for regional climate change and fire in South Asia, but no obvious environmental trigger for C success in North America. CO-starvation is implicated in the origins of C plants 25–32 Myr ago, raising the possibility that the pathway evolved under more extreme atmospheric conditions experienced 10 times earlier. However, our geochemical analyses provide no evidence of the C mechanism at this time, although possible ancestral components of the C pathway are identified in ancient plant lineages. We suggest that future research must redress the substantial imbalance between experimental investigations and analyses of the geological record.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Among metazoans, retention of functional diet-derived chloroplasts (kleptoplasty) is known only from the sea slug taxon Sacoglossa (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia). Intracellular maintenance of plastids in the slug's digestive epithelium has long attracted interest given its implications for understanding the evolution of endosymbiosis. However, photosynthetic ability varies widely among sacoglossans; some species have no plastid retention while others survive for months solely on photosynthesis. We present a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Sacoglossa and a survey of kleptoplasty from representatives of all major clades. We sought to quantify variation in photosynthetic ability among lineages, identify phylogenetic origins of plastid retention, and assess whether kleptoplasty was a key character in the radiation of the Sacoglossa.RESULTS:Three levels of photosynthetic activity were detected: (1) no functional retention; (2) short-term retention lasting about one week; and (3) long-term retention for over a month. Phylogenetic analysis of one nuclear and two mitochondrial loci revealed reciprocal monophyly of the shelled Oxynoacea and shell-less Plakobranchacea, the latter comprising a monophyletic Plakobranchoidea and paraphyletic Limapontioidea. Only species in the Plakobranchoidea expressed short- or long-term kleptoplasty, most belonging to a speciose clade of slugs bearing parapodia (lateral flaps covering the dorsum). Bayesian ancestral character state reconstructions indicated that functional short-term retention arose once in the last common ancestor of Plakobranchoidea, and independently evolved into long-term retention in four derived species.CONCLUSION:We propose a sequential progression from short- to long-term kleptoplasty, with different adaptations involved in each step. Short-term kleptoplasty likely arose as a deficiency in plastid digestion, yielding additional energy via the release of fixed carbon. Functional short-term retention was an apomorphy of the Plakobranchoidea, but the subsequent evolution of parapodia enabled slugs to protect kleptoplasts against high irradiance and further prolong plastid survival. We conclude that functional short-term retention was necessary but not sufficient for an adaptive radiation in the Plakobranchoidea, especially in the genus Elysia which comprises a third of all sacoglossan species. The adaptations necessary for long-term chloroplast survival arose independently in species feeding on different algal hosts, providing a valuable study system for examining the parallel evolution of this unique trophic strategy.},

The change in the standard transformed Gibbs energy of reaction DeltarG`o gives the apparent equilibrium constant K`, and the standard transformed enthalpy DeltarH`o gives the temperature coefficient of K`. The corresponding standard transformed entropy of reaction DeltarS`o is less often discussed but is often easier to interpret in terms of structure. The standard transformed entropies of formation of 44 biochemical reactants are calculated at 298.15 K, 1 bar, pH 7, and ionic strengths of 0, 0.10, and 0.25 M from values of the standard Gibbs energies of formation DeltafGo and standard enthalpies of formation DeltafHo of the species involved. These values are used to calculate DeltarS`o for 19 biochemical reactions to illustrate the role that entropy plays in these reactions. DeltafS`o values for biochemical reactants at a specified pH can also be calculated from standard molar entropies of the species involved in a reactant. The standard transformed formation properties of biochemical reactants can be estimated by adding up group contributions. The contributions of 15 groups to DeltafG`o and DeltafH`o at pH 7 and three ionic strengths are calculated and used to estimate DeltafG`o and DeltafH`omicron for seven reactants. This shows that standard transformed formation properties can be estimated for biochemical reactants for which there are no equilibrium or calorimetric data.},

In phiB-containing RCs, the first excited state of the primary donor (P*) decays with an accelerated time constant of 2.6 +- 0.1 ps at room temperature as compared to 3.1 +- 0.2 ps in wild-type (WT) RCs. At low temperatures, P* decay is essentially the same in the HL(M182) mutant and WT RCs: 1.4 +- 0.1 ps at 77 K and 1.1 +- 0.1 ps at 9 K. The yield of the charge-separated P+phiB- state decreases from 35\% at room temperature to 12\% at 77 and 9 K. The decreased P+phiB- yield is apparently due to the fact that the rate of the charge separation along the A side of the RC at low temperature increases, while the rate along the B side remains essentially unchanged. From measurements of the long-lived fluorescence decay at room temperature, the standard free energy of the P+phiB- state is estimated to be about 0.16 +- 0.04 eV below P*. Given a difference between the midpoint potentials of BChl and BPheo of 0.26 +- 0.03 V, the standard free energy of the P+BB- state in WT RC is estimated to be 0.1 +- 0.07 eV above P*.},

Stomatal responses to leaf-to-air vapour mole fraction difference (D, leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference divided by atmospheric pressure) were first determined by a literature review and by assuming that stomatal behaviour results in the optimisation of plant water use in relation to carbon gain. Using monthly time steps, modelled stomatal responses toD were used to calculate the ratio of stomatal cavity to ambient CO2 mole fractions and then, in association with leaf internal conductances, to calculate ?A. Weighted according to gross primary productivity (GPP, annual net CO2 asimilation per unit ground area), estimated ?A for C3 biomes ranged from 12.9‰ for xerophytic woods and shrub to 19.6‰ for cool/cold deciduous forest, with an average value from C3 plants of 17.8‰. This is slightly less than the commonly used values of 18–20‰. For C4 plants the average modelled discrimination was 3.6‰, again slightly less than would be calculated from C4 plant dry matter carbon isotopic composition (yielding around 5‰). From our model we estimate that, on a global basis, 21\% of GPP is by C4 plants and for the terrestrial biosphere as a whole we calculate an average isotope discrimination during photosynthesis of 14.8‰. There are large variations in ?A across the globe, the largest of which are associated with the precence or absence of C4 plants. Due to longitudinal variations in ?A, there are problems in using latitudinally averaged terrestrial carbon isotope discriminations to calculate the ratio of net oceanic to net terrestrial carbon fluxes.},

	abstract = {The 18O content of CO2 is a powerful tracer of photosynthetic activity at the ecosystem and global scale. Due to oxygen exchange between CO2 and 18O-enriched leaf water and retrodiffusion of most of this CO2 back to the atmosphere, leaves effectively discriminate against 18O during photosynthesis. Discrimination against 18O (039418O) is expected to be lower in C4 plants because of low ci and hence low retrodiffusing CO2 flux. C4 plants also generally show lower levels of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities than C3 plants. Low CA may limit the extent of 18O exchange and further reduce 039418O. We investigated CO22013H2O isotopic equilibrium in plants with naturally low CA activity, including two C4 (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor) and one C3 (Phragmites australis) species. The results confirmed experimentally the occurrence of low 039418O in C4, as well as in some C3, plants. Variations in CA activity and in the extent of CO22013H2O isotopic equilibrium (03B8eq) estimated from on-line measurements of 039418O showed large range of 02013100\% isotopic equilibrium (03B8eq= 020131). This was consistent with direct estimates based on assays of CA activity and measurements of CO2 concentrations and residence times in the leaves. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of 039418O as indicator of CA activity in vivo. Sensitivity tests indicated also that the impact of 03B8eq\&lt; 1 (incomplete isotopic equilibrium) on 18O of atmospheric CO2 can be similar for C3 and C4 plants and in both cases it increases with natural enrichment of 18O in leaf water.},

The considerable substrate ambiguity of these enzymes resulted in the formation of minor amounts of erroneous products. Fortuitous formation of metabolites offered ancient cells maximum biochemical flexibility with minimal gene content. Gene duplication provided the opportunity for increased gene content and increased specialization of the diverging enzymes, the substrate specialization being further reinforced by the development of regualtory mechanisms. Recuritment of enzymes for new pathways did not necessarily require the sequential and backwardly evolving progression of evolutionary steps required by the hypothesis of retrograde evolution of biochemical pathways. Substrate ambiguity remains a conspicuous feature of many contemporary proteins, and evolutionary exploitation of substrate ambiguity in a variety of organisms is still apparent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes.RESULTS:We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme.CONCLUSION:Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical network - manually or automatically - into a dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

Within this modeling framework, linear optimization has been used to study genome-scale metabolic models, resulting in the enumeration of single optimal solutions describing the best use of the network to support growth. Here mixed-integer linear programming was used to calculate and study a subset of the alternate optimal solutions for a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli (iJR904) under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Analysis of the calculated sets of optimal solutions found that: (1) only a small subset of reactions in the network have variable fluxes across optima; (2) sets of reactions that are always used together in optimal solutions, correlated reaction sets, showed moderate agreement with the currently known transcriptional regulatory structure in E. coli and available expression data, and (3) reactions that are used under certain environmental conditions can provide clues about network regulatory needs. In addition, calculation of suboptimal flux distributions, using flux variability analysis, identified reactions which are used under significantly more environmental conditions suboptimally than optimally. Together these results demonstrate the utilization of reactions in genome-scale models under a variety of different growth conditions.},

Using a combination of genetic engineering and transgenic technology, three approaches to reduce photorespiration have been taken; two of these focused on increasing the carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco either by reducing the oxygenase reaction directly or by manipulating the Rubisco enzyme by concentrating CO2 in the region of Rubisco through the introduction of enzymes of the C4 pathway. The third approach attempted to reduce photorespiration directly by manipulation of enzymes in this pathway. The progress in each of these areas is discussed, and the most promising approaches are highlighted. Under saturating CO2 conditions, Rubisco did not limit photosynthesis, and limitation shifted to ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration capacity of the C3 cycle. Transgenic analysis was used to identify the specific enzymes that may be targets for improving carbon fixation, and the way this may be exploited in the high CO2 future is considered.},

When the mutant was grown on gluconate-1-14C, alanine isolated from protein was unlabeled, showing that the dehydrase was absent in vivo and that the sole pathway of gluconate metabolism in the mutant was the hexose monophosphate shunt. The mutant grew on gluconate with a doubling time of 155 min, compared with the parent strain's 56 min. On glucose and fructose it grew with normal doubling times.

	abstract = {Human tyrosine aminotransferase (hTATase) is the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transamination of tyrosine to p-hydrophenylpyruvate, an important step in tyrosine metabolism. hTATase deficiency is implicated in the rare metabolic disorder, tyrosinemia type II. This enzyme is a member of the poorly characterized Igamma subfamily of the family I aminotransferases. The full length and truncated forms of recombinant hTATase were expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. The pH-dependent titration of wild-type reveals a spectrum characteristic of family I aminotransferases with an aldimine pK(a) of 7.22. I249A mutant hTATase exhibits an unusual spectrum with a similar aldimine pK(a) (6.85). hTATase has very narrow substrate specificity with the highest enzymatic activity for the Tyr/alpha-ketoglutarate substrate pair, which gives a steady state k(cat) value of 83 s(-1). In contrast there is no detectable transamination of aspartate or other cosubstrates. The present findings show that hTATase is the only known aminotransferase that discriminates significantly between Tyr and Phe: the k(cat)/K(m) value for Tyr is about four orders of magnitude greater than that for Phe. A comparison of substrate specificities of representative Ialpha and Igamma aminotransferases is described along with the physiological significance of the discrimination between Tyr and Phe by hTATase as applied to the understanding of the molecular basis of phenylketonuria.},

Examples include monitorings of the rate of hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide by eel acetylcholinesterase and the rate of hydrolysis of malathion and nonconventional esters such as O-methyl, O-ethyl, and O-isobutyl carbonates of p-nitrophenol by commercial porcine liver carboxylesterase. Data obtained from the plate reader were compared to those obtained, under similar conditions, in a conventional spectrophotometer. Absorbance measurements made in both machines on the same solution, as well as absorbance changes measured over time, were similar. The use of the 96-well plate format tremendously increased the number of enzyme assays carried out per person and the interface with a personal computer allowed rapid manipulation of the absorbance values to calculate the desired rate data. This approach should be generally applicable to many routine colorimetric assays in the research laboratory.},

	abstract = {This paper presents estimates of daily average per capita fish consumption by age and gender for the 48 conterminous states. The estimated consumption rates are reported for three fish habitats: freshwater/estuarine fish, marine fish, and all fish. The estimates were generated from the combined 1989, 1990, and 1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII), a national food consumption survey conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Point and interval estimates of per capita fish consumption were generated from the empirical distribution of daily average per capita consumption. The point estimates include the mean, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles. Ninety percent confidence intervals are provided for the estimated mean and 90\% bootstrap intervals are provided for percentile estimates. Information in a recipe file provided by USDA was used to calculate the amount of fish in recipes which contain fish. The estimated consumption rates are based on the weight of fish in its prepared or "as consumed" condition. The estimated mean consumption rate for all fish for the U.S. population of the 48 conterminous states was 15.65 grams/person/day (C.I.:14.67201316.63) of which 4.71 grams/person/day (C.I.:4.1720135.25) was freshwater/estuarine fish and 10.94 grams/person/day (C.I.: 10.14201311.73) was marine fish.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including the possible advantage of sexual reproduction, depend critically on the effects of deleterious mutations on fitness. Limited existing experimental evidence suggests that, on average, such effects tend to be aggravated under environmental stresses, consistent with the perception that stress diminishes the organism's ability to tolerate deleterious mutations. Here, we ask whether there are also stresses with the opposite influence, under which the organism becomes more tolerant to mutations. RESULTS: We developed a technique, based on bioluminescence, which allows accurate automated measurements of bacterial growth rates at very low cell densities. Using this system, we measured growth rates of Escherichia coli mutants under a diverse set of environmental stresses. In contrast to the perception that stress always reduces the organism's ability to tolerate mutations, our measurements identified stresses that do the opposite - that is, despite decreasing wild-type growth, they alleviate, on average, the effect of deleterious mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a qualitative difference between various environmental stresses ranging from alleviation to aggravation of the average effect of mutations. We further show how the existence of stresses that are biased towards alleviation of the effects of mutations may imply the existence of average epistatic interactions between mutations. The results thus offer a connection between the two main factors controlling the effects of deleterious mutations: environmental conditions and epistatic interactions.},

	abstract = {The capacity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) to consume RuBP is a major limitation on the rate of net CO(2) assimilation (A) in C(3) and C(4) plants. The pattern of Rubisco limitation differs between the two photosynthetic types, as shown by comparisons of temperature and CO(2) responses of A and Rubisco activity from C(3) and C(4) species. In C(3) species, Rubisco capacity is the primary limitation on A at light saturation and CO(2) concentrations below the current atmospheric value of 37 Pa, particularly near the temperature optimum. Below 20 degrees C, C(3) photosynthesis at 37 and 68 Pa is often limited by the capacity to regenerate phosphate for photophosphorylation. In C(4) plants, the Rubisco capacity is equivalent to A below 18 degrees C, but exceeds the photosynthetic capacity above 25 degrees C, indicating that Rubisco is an important limitation at cool but not warm temperatures. A comparison of the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco (k(cat) in mol CO(2) mol(-1) Rubisco active sites s(-1)) from 17 C(3) and C(4) plants showed that Rubisco from C(4) species, and C(3) species originating in cool environments, had higher k(cat) than Rubisco from C(3) species originating in warm environments. This indicates that Rubisco evolved to improve performance in the environment that plants normally experience. In C(4) plants, and C(3) species from cool environments, Rubisco often operates near CO(2) saturation, so that increases in k(cat) would enhance A. In warm-habitat C(4) species, Rubisco often operates at CO(2) concentrations below the K(m) for CO(2). Because k(cat) and K(m) vary proportionally, the low k(cat) indicates that Rubisco has been modified in a manner that reduces K(m) and thus increases the affinity for CO(2) in C(3) species from warm climates.},

The two genes encoding d-ornithine aminomutase have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The oraS gene, which encodes a protein of 121 amino acid residues with M(r) 12,800, is situated upstream of the oraE gene, which encodes a protein of 753 amino acid residues with M(r) 82,900. The holoenzyme appears to comprise a alpha(2)beta(2)-heterotetramer. OraS shows no significant homology to other proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. The deduced amino acid sequence of OraE includes a conserved base-off/histidine-on cobalamin-binding motif, DXHXXG. OraE was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Refolding experiments on OraE indicate that the interactions between OraS and OraE and the binding of either pyridoxal phosphate or adenosylcobalamin play important roles in refolding process. The K(m) values for d-ornithine, 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) are 44.5 +/- 2.8, 0.43 +/- 0.04, and 1.5 +/- 0.1 microm, respectively; the k(cat) is 6.3 +/- 0.1 s(-1). The reaction was absolutely dependent upon OraE, OraS, AdoCbl, PLP, and D-ornithine being present in the assay; no other cofactors were required. A red-shift in UV-visible absorption spectrum is observed when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by recombinant D-ornithine aminomutase and no significant change in spectrum when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by mutant OraE-H618G, demonstrating that the enzyme binds adenosylcobalamin in base-off/histidine-on mode.},

CP1 has been shown to participate in the binding of tRNA as well as the editing of the reaction intermediate aminoacyl-AMP or the aminoacyl-tRNA. No function has been assigned to CP2. The amino acid sequence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans TrpRS was predicted from the genome sequence. Protein sequence alignments revealed that A. ferrooxidans TrpRS contains a 70 amino acids long CP2 that is not found in any other bacterial TrpRS. However, a CP2 in the same relative position was found in the predicted sequence of several archaeal TrpRSs. A. ferrooxidans TrpRS is functional in vivo in Escherichia coli. A deletion mutant of A. ferrooxidans trpS lacking the coding region of CP2 was constructed. The in vivo activity of the mutant TrpRS in E. coli, as well as the kinetic parameters of the in vitro activation of tryptophan by ATP, were not altered by the deletion. However, the K(m) value for tRNA was seven-fold higher upon deletion, reducing the efficiency of aminoacylation. Structural modeling suggests that CP2 binds to the inner corner of the L shape of tRNA.},

This challenge is important not just for fundamental but also practical considerations arising from the need to design microorganisms exquisitely tuned for particular applications.

In this paper, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of M. genitalium that mathematically describes a unified characterization of its biochemical capabilities. The model accounts for 189 of the 482 genes listed in the latest genome annotation. We used computational tools during the process to bridge network gaps in the model and restore consistency with experimental data that determined which gene deletions led to cell death (i.e., are essential). We achieved 87\% correct model predictions for essential genes and 89\% for non-essential genes. We subsequently used the metabolic model to determine components that must be part of the growth medium. The approaches and tools described here provide a roadmap for the automated metabolic reconstruction of other organisms. This task is becoming increasingly critical as genome sequencing for new organisms is proceeding at an ever-accelerating pace.},

	abstract = {Perennial herbaceous plants such as switchgrass ( L.) are being evaluated as cellulosic bioenergy crops. Two major concerns have been the net energy efficiency and economic feasibility of switchgrass and similar crops. All previous energy analyses have been based on data from research plots ({\textless}5 m) and estimated inputs. We managed switchgrass as a biomass energy crop in field trials of 3–9 ha (1 ha = 10,000 m) on marginal cropland on 10 farms across a wide precipitation and temperature gradient in the midcontinental U.S. to determine net energy and economic costs based on known farm inputs and harvested yields. In this report, we summarize the agricultural energy input costs, biomass yield, estimated ethanol output, greenhouse gas emissions, and net energy results. Annual biomass yields of established fields averaged 5.2 -11.1 Mg·ha with a resulting average estimated net energy yield (NEY) of 60 GJ·ha·y. Switchgrass produced 540\% more renewable than nonrenewable energy consumed. Switchgrass monocultures managed for high yield produced 93\% more biomass yield and an equivalent estimated NEY than previous estimates from human-made prairies that received low agricultural inputs. Estimated average greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cellulosic ethanol derived from switchgrass were 94\% lower than estimated GHG from gasoline. This is a baseline study that represents the genetic material and agronomic technology available for switchgrass production in 2000 and 2001, when the fields were planted. Improved genetics and agronomics may further enhance energy sustainability and biofuel yield of switchgrass.},
